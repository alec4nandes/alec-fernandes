<h3 class="subtitle">Learn about Firebase’s onSnapshot listener.</h3> <p class="date-posted">January 25, 2023 at 12:19 pm PST</p> <figure> <img src="/blog/feature-images/kings-corner.jpg"/> <figcaption>The logo I designed for <a href="/arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kings Corner</a>.</figcaption> </figure> <div><p><a href="/arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View this project.</em></a></p> <p> If I were a JavaScript teacher, my final project for the class would ask each student to build a card game of their choice. It would be a great exercise in data structuring – I personally love JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Set data object</a> for projects like these – and the game logic requires state management and rule checking to ensure each play is valid. I know all this from experience building my own card game. </p> <p> Last year I taught some friends a game called <a href="/arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kings Corner</a> and discovered it was a hit after each new player couldn't seem to get enough. The easiest way to describe it is "multi-player solitaire" – you can <a href="/arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn more about the rules here</a> after registering for an account. </p> <p> Thanks to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Firebase</a> I was able to quickly set up account authentication and game data storage. What I really needed, however, was a database listener that could push each move update to the user interface in real time. I didn't want players to manually refresh the app to check if it's their turn. </p> <p> Thankfully, Firebase has <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">onSnapshot</a>. I set up this listener in my React app using the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useEffect hook</a> and an empty array of dependencies. This creates the listener when the app initially loads, returning any changes detected in the game's database right after they're committed. </p> <pre><code><xmp>useEffect(
    () => {
        // load the game and listen for changes
        const theDoc = doc(firestore, "Games", gameKey),
            unsubscribe = onSnapshot(theDoc, gameplayCallback);
        // unsubscribe when the component unmounts
        return unsubscribe;
    },
    []
);
</xmp></code></pre> <p> Now I could see my opponent's moves as they made them, click by click or tap by tap. It was almost as fun as sitting at the table with friends and family – the only thing missing was the lively laughter and conversation, which is why I plan to include a chat feature in the near future. </p> <p> If no one's online to play, the computer can serve as a worthy adversary. The computer plays using a recursive function that keeps scanning cards until no more valid plays remain. The algorithm was simple to implement yet difficult to beat; I had created a perfectionist player that really keeps you on your toes. </p> <p> I loved turning a relatively unknown card game into a web app that people anywhere can enjoy, but the best reward has been the joy it's brought my loved ones. Hopefully interest keeps growing. If it does, I would like to start a player mailing list and even look into generating some ad revenue. </p> <p> My own advertising budget only stretches so far, so if you love <a href="/arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kings Corner</a> would you consider sharing <a href="/arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> with your loved ones?

Every layout was a visual exercise that let me express myself beyond the written word, but there were still rules. A good publication doesn't bury the big story on the back page and everything has to fit perfectly within the margins – there can be no excessive whitespace and no text overflow. </p> <p> Web design doesn't have these physical restrictions. There is no limited real estate for 5,000-word stories and many readers no longer flip pages, they scroll them. Maybe the most exciting feature of the web is our ability to navigate content in a virtual 3-dimensional space thanks to advanced CSS features. Text can now come to life in ways that engage users beyond the content of the words. </p> <p> For instance, rather than scrolling straight down a long website with many articles you could instead flip some 3D object to reveal new content on each side. I used this design not for news articles, but for Buddhism's Eightfold Path by building <a href="/dharma-gem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a virtual 8-sided die</a> where each face contains one part of the Path. To create this object I used CSS's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clip-path property</a> to cut the eight square divs into triangles, CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transform</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transition</a> to angle and flip them, and React's <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">useState hook</a> to keep track of which side was showing. </p> <p> Building the base object was like sculpting clay in a digital 3D environment. I grew more excited as the page acquired greater depth and dimension. Formatting the text of each side, however, was a little less enjoyable. I just couldn't find a uniform layout for my diverse set of data. After playing around with different text templates and not finding the right one, I learned the importance of decoupling. </p> <p> My computer science professors drilled into me maxims that apply across all programming languages. One of these was DRY – an acronym that stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." An example of the DRY principle is declaring a single function and calling it in multiple places rather than writing that function's declaration over and over again throughout the code. It's a practical approach that has reduced file sizes in all my projects, yet when programmers decide to be DRY they risk coupling their code too tightly. </p> <p> Coupling is when two or more components share functions and data. We want our code to be DRY yet not too tightly coupled. The codebase becomes difficult to manage when this happens, as I discovered with my SideText component in React. </p> <p> This component formatted text in a highly coupled way, which would have worked if the data for each side were more symmetrical. Some parts of the Eightfold Path had arrays that others didn't and even extra images. Pretty soon this single component I built was full of conditional renders. Sections of text were displaying in different places depending on if there were images or not, and using the same component for every side no longer made sense. </p> <p> When I eventually decoupled the SideText component into separate layouts, I still kept my code as DRY as possible. I extracted shared features into sub-components and then imported them as needed to give each face its own format and personality. By using these modular imports I was obeying all those professors' voices that echoed inside my head, commanding me: "Don't Repeat Yourself!" I did, however, end up with multiple component files instead of just one SideText.js, but this was necessary to achieve the look I wanted. </p> <p> Decoupling finally allowed me to create <a href="/dharma-gem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fun digital 3D resource for anyone studying the Eightfold Path</a>. If you're struggling to balance how a site looks and behaves across many different elements, ask yourself if the code is too tightly coupled. Fixing this just might provide the extra flexibility you need to finish that amazing app. </p> </div> <div class="tags"> tags: <ul class="commas"> <li> <a href="/tags/projects.html">projects</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/css.html">CSS</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/3d.html">3D</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/coupling.html">coupling</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/react.html">React</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/layouts.html">layouts</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/dry.html">DRY</a> </li> </ul> </div> <button class="share-button" onclick="copyLink()"> share <img src="/assets/icons8-share-24.png" alt=""/> </button> </article> <article> <h2 class="title"> <a href="/blog/iching.html">I-Ching</a> </h2> <h3 class="subtitle">Consult an ancient oracle on a modern webpage.</h3> <p class="date-posted">January 25, 2023 at 12:19 pm PST</p> <figure> <img src="/blog/feature-images/iching.jpg"/> <figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hrustall?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Дмитрий Хрусталев-Григорьев</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/CFqUdmzzti0?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption> </figure> <div><p><a href="/iching" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View this project.</em></a></p> <p> It's difficult to live a spiritual life in Southern California. Here toxic body images and inflated egos are unavoidable, but a Taoist outlook keeps me humble. How can you be upset or self-conscious when you realize nothing lasts forever? To the Taoist, life is nothing more than a rhythmic tidal current of lows and highs, yin and yang. </p> <p> Yet one of the few things to remain constant over the past three millennia is the I-Ching. It is a divinatory reference for China's ancient oracles and one of the most famous texts of Taoism. Personally, I find it to be a bit too esoteric (and that's saying a lot!), but I'm interested in the parts of the I-Ching that are related to computer science, mainly binary code. </p> <p> The old text combines the binary of yin and yang in triplicate to form <a href="/iching/bagua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight classical elements</a> (2^3=8), then joins these elements into <a href="/iching/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64 different pairs</a> (8^2=64) called hexagrams. I found it mathematically fascinating and decided to write my own JavaScript program for telling fortunes with the I-Ching. </p> <p> The divination method and logic were pretty straightforward and therefore easy to implement as JavaScript, but making it all look realistic was a different story. Modern I-Ching readings involve flipping three coins six times to get a hexagram, and I had a vision of three virtual coins flipping and falling on the screen before the user sees a reading. It was an enjoyable design challenge that combined separate CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animations</a> at random <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intervals</a> set with JavaScript. I wrote a post about <a href="/post/?id=rotate-2-sided-object-show-both-sides-CSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the flip animations here</a>. </p> <p> What was once a single boring click is now a dynamic experience. The user feels even more actively involved in their reading by watching the coin flips that will determine their fate. I highly encourage you to <a href="/iching/cast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check it out here</a>. Who knows? You might end up with some good advice. </p></div> <div class="tags"> tags: <ul class="commas"> <li> <a href="/tags/projects.html">projects</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/css.html">CSS</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/animations.html">animations</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/taoism.html">Taoism</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/china.html">China</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/yin-and-yang.html">yin and yang</a> </li> </ul> </div> <button class="share-button" onclick="copyLink()"> share <img src="/assets/icons8-share-24.png" alt=""/> </button> </article> <article> <h2 class="title"> <a href="/blog/timers.html">Timers</a> </h2> <h3 class="subtitle">Learn how to repeatedly play the same sound file on mobile using setInterval in JS.</h3> <p class="date-posted">January 25, 2023 at 12:18 pm PST</p> <figure> <img src="/blog/feature-images/timers.jpg"/> <figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@agebarros?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agê Barros</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/rBPOfVqROzY?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption> </figure> <div><p><a href="/timers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View this project.</em></a></p> <p> Okay fine. I admit it. I'm not perfect. And before you inevitably try to convince me otherwise, I'll reveal my biggest flaw in the workplace: I'm not good at taking breaks. </p> <p> It's hard to stop myself when I'm caught in a creative flow. I was also raised to be an overachiever, so for a long time I saw taking more breaks as being less productive. Only after pushing myself to <a href="https://www.today.com/health/arianna-huffington-collapse-exhaustion-was-wake-call-2D79644042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-2007 Arianna Huffington stress levels</a> did I realize the importance of taking regular breaks. </p> <p> My favorite method for achieving this is the <em>Pomodoro Timer</em>. It alerts you to take a short break after a fixed interval of time. I find I stay the most creative by taking five minute breaks after every 25 minutes or so of work. At first 25 minutes didn't even seem like enough time to get settled, but I was amazed to discover how much I could get done in that span when I quickly and regularly refreshed myself. It improved my workflow so much that I decided to design <a href="/timers/pomodoro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own Pomodoro Timer</a>. </p> <p> The implementation wasn't anything too complicated &mdash; just alternating <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setIntervals</a> marked by two distinct sounds. I also used this approach to create <a href="/timers/workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a more flexible workout timer</a> that announces what number repetition the user is starting. All of this worked great on desktop, but mobile was a different story. </p> <p> It turns out on mobile you can automatically play a JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio object</a> (such as the timer's beep), but without further user interaction (such as clicking a button) the sound only plays once. This was a big problem for a web app that played automated beeps after several intervals of work and break time. </p> <p> After identifying the issue above with the help of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a>, it occurred to me that I could automatically play the same sound multiple times on mobile devices if I created arrays full of separate Audio objects that play the same sound. Iterating through these identical playbacks would trick the browser into thinking it's playing a brand new sound automatically for the first time. </p> <pre><code><xmp>/*
    Mobile browsers will not play sounds repeatedly with setInterval.
    Create arrays of Audio objects to play separately.
*/

const breakBeeps = [],
    workBeeps = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 24; i++) {
    breakBeeps.push(new Audio("./audio/break-start-beep.mp3"));
    workBeeps.push(new Audio("./audio/break-end-beep.mp3"));
}
</xmp></code></pre> <p> I'm happy to say this hack worked, and now I can successfully use <a href="/timers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">both timers</a> when I'm away from my desktop. If you haven't ever tried integrating a productivity timer into your workflow, I highly suggest you do.

I've dabbled in tarot and Kabbalah, studied different religions and have always enjoyed learning new languages. My esoteric side has raised the eyebrows of my more science-minded colleagues, but I draw inspiration from the visceral imagery of the arcane. It's what inspired me to design <a href="/dharma-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this card deck</a> built using the web's frontend languages. </p> <p> It combines elements of tarot, Kabbalah, Buddhism and Taoism. I wanted to take spiritual concepts largely unfamiliar to Western culture and present them in a more relatable format: a deck of playing cards. In all honesty, I think the idea of the deck could use a little more work yet I'm happy with its design. My goal was to use as few image files as possible, but I'm no <a href="https://diana-adrianne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diana Smith</a>. Some of the more complex backgrounds I cropped from Tibetan religious art. </p> <p> I created the cards using JavaScript to combine information about each suit and rank, then I mapped through each set of data and wrote it into a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">template-literal</a> HTML string. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">innerHTML</a> injects this code and external stylesheets modify it. There were no real challenges with this project, except maybe mathematically solving where to place each suit symbol on the numbered cards. It brought up memories of my trigonometry class, proving to all my incredulous peers back then that yes, one day I would be using this. </p> <p> I used many of my frontend skills while designing <a href="/dharma-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this deck</a> as a creative exercise. If it inspires you with any ideas about its use, please reach out!

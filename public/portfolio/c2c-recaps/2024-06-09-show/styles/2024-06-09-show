type-html"><div class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, the only child of actor Boris Karloff, <a href="https://karloff.com/" target="_blank"><u>Sara Karloff</u></a>, discussed her father's on-screen legacy, especially his famous roles playing the monster in the classic Frankenstein films and Imhotep in 1932's The Mummy. While speaking with <a href="https://www.conniewillis.com/" target="_blank"><u>Connie Willis</u></a> (<a href="https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/" target="_blank"><u>info</u></a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

<p>In the second half, <a href="https://centerlane-rv.org/" target="_blank"><u>Shane Ivie</u></a> shared his experience as an advanced-level remote viewer and how he uses this skill to pick winning horses at the race track. Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;</p>

<p>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.</p>

the first half, the only child of actor Boris Karloff, \u003ca href=\"https://karloff.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Sara Karloff\u003c/u>\u003c/a>, discussed her father's on-screen legacy, especially his famous roles playing the monster in the classic Frankenstein films and Imhotep in 1932's The Mummy. While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

In the first half, he delved into conspiracy theories and why people are drawn to them. While this kind of thinking dates back to early civilizations, nowadays, such theories rapidly spread on the Internet, and many followers/believers can be gained in short order. &quot;Anomaly hunters&quot; search through every photo and video, focusing on minutia, weird shadows, and things that don't seem to fit. The recent assassination attempt on Trump is an example of that, he said, though he conceded in this case, there actually are a &quot;number of anomalies and peculiarities that are going to have to be addressed.&quot; Perhaps it just boils down to incompetence on the part of the Secret Service or law enforcement, Shermer added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>We all believe some conspiracy theories, and that's a good thing because some of them are real, he noted, such as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Iran Contra, and MK-ULTRA, the CIA mind control program. On the topic of ET visitation, he doubts aliens have visited Earth, though he does believe it's likely that extraterrestrial life exists out there, and he is affiliated with Avi Loeb's \u003ca href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home\" target=\"_blank\">Galileo Project\u003c/a> in that regard. He also touched on alien abductions, and the malleability of memory, such as when people are recovering memories via hypnosis. Shermer has concluded that alien abductions are likely related to sleep paralysis episodes, where the dark figures that appear to those in a quasi-dream state are interpreted as menacing ETs, whereas in past eras, they were identified as demons or devils.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and medium \u003ca href=\"http://susangrau.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Grau\u003c/a> talked about dying, her near-death experience (NDE), angel encounters, and how a greater understanding of the afterlife can help us connect with our loved ones who have passed on. Her NDE at an early age had a profound impact on her views of spirituality and the afterlife. During the experience, she traveled to various locations, including a room of knowledge, a room of companions, and a &quot;yellow brick road&quot; that represented the path of one's journey. She also experienced a vision of unconditional love on a mountain, in which she saw a beatific being that was like a &quot;beam of light&quot; who made her feel complete and perfect.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the subject of grief for our lost loved ones, she emphasized that there is no time limit for it as it's directly related to the love for the person who has passed, and yet the knowledge that they continue on in spirit can be a comfort. When people die, they are never alone, she said, as there is someone on the Other Side, as well as angels, to greet them or come get them. There's nothing to fear about the spirit world, as it's where we come from and where we return, she pointed out. As to what to expect in the afterlife, she portrayed the realm as pulsating, vibrant, and beautiful with indescribable colors. Grau shared stories of her communicating with the deceased, and gave readings for callers in the last hour.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

the first half, the only child of actor Boris Karloff, \u003ca href=\"https://karloff.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Sara Karloff\u003c/u>\u003c/a>, discussed her father's on-screen legacy, especially his famous roles playing the monster in the classic Frankenstein films and Imhotep in 1932's The Mummy. While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

the first half, the only child of actor Boris Karloff, \u003ca href=\"https://karloff.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Sara Karloff\u003c/u>\u003c/a>, discussed her father's on-screen legacy, especially his famous roles playing the monster in the classic Frankenstein films and Imhotep in 1932's The Mummy. While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

While speaking with \u003ca href=\"https://www.conniewillis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Connie Willis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>info\u003c/u>\u003c/a>), she highlighted her father's down-to-earth nature, saying he &quot;was a very modest, humble man and very grateful for being able to spend his life doing something he truly loved.&quot; He was an industry pioneer beyond just the horror genre, Karloff said, noting the importance he placed on organizations such as the Screen Actors Guild. As one of the earliest members of the group, he sought to give up-and-coming actors a voice. Karloff pointed out the rough working conditions her father endured, saying that filming &quot;was like a 19-hour day, and day after day. At that point, actors were nothing but a piece of meat to the producers.&quot; She relayed a quote from Alfred Lunt that her father was fond of that described his view of his craft: &quot;I listen for my cue, I check my fly, I take a deep breath, and I go on stage and hope that I don't bump into anybody.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In a surprising revelation, she told listeners that her father wasn't even invited to the premiere of Frankenstein. &quot;It was not anticipated that the monster would be the star of the film,&quot; Karloff stated. Clearly, his absence from the event had no effect on his lasting fame. &quot;My dad was honored on three postage stamps… that's a record,&quot; Karloff said. Speaking of her own relationship to the horror genre, she is a self-described &quot;wuss.&quot; She confessed that once, while invited to preview a haunted house attraction, she demanded that all the lights stay on. &quot;It's a pretty well known fact that I do not like scary movies,&quot; Karloff said. &quot;There are many of my father's films I have not seen.&quot; That in no way stops her from honoring her father's legacy, which she has learned more about through classic-movie buffs. &quot;I learn more from fans than I could ever know,&quot; said Karloff. &quot;I have a lot to thank him for,&quot; she continued, but she also doesn't see herself as living in his shadow. &quot;One has to learn to cast one's own shadow,&quot; Karloff said.

Ivie was trained by some of the original personnel from the once super-secret, US military psychic spy program that eventually became known as Star Gate. He talked about discovering the technique 28 years ago on Coast to Coast, saying, &quot;I heard about remote viewing on the Art Bell show, and it just fascinated me.&quot; Ivie's journey led him deep into the subconscious mind, unveiling a world of symbols that point to things distant or hidden from view. &quot;Our subconscious speaks to us. At a certain point, I became a student of my own subconscious,&quot; he stated. &quot;It was teaching me the language that it has.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing his process, he acknowledged that his visions can be both direct and indirect in their interpretation. &quot;In looking at these pictures, you'll see there's a language of the subconscious that speaks in analogy,&quot; Ivie claimed. &quot;Sometimes you get literal definitions of the horse's name. It looks exactly like what the horse's name is. And then many, many times it's sort of a metaphor for the horse's name.&quot; He also discussed how remote viewing horse races can sometimes be an overwhelming process when not practiced in moderation. &quot;I'll go months without doing a horse race, just to let everything cycle through and horses filter out to the different circuits, and then I'll come back at it,&quot; he said. &quot;So when I feel confident, I don't remote view one race after the other, because I think the process degrades a bit.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ivie has sharpened his skills over the years, saying he's &quot;shortened the amount of time it takes to do these sessions. I could do these sessions within a half hour of the race. Do the session in 15 minutes, look at the entries, put a bet on, watch the race, catch the ticket, and it's fast.&quot; He says his success rate ranges from 54-57 percent, and he is now teaching others how to strengthen their abilities. &quot;If you want to learn how to do this, I will be ramping up… formal training for remote viewing,&quot; Ivie stated.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"America","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Rick Springfield","title":"Jessie's Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00136Q4V4/ctoc"},{"artist":"A Taste of Honey","title":"Sukiyaki","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V5Q5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Bobby Pickett","title":"Monster Mash","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000001FX7/ctoc"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Too Much Time on My Hands","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001ZMXDG/ctoc"},{"artist":"Alan Parsons Project","title":"Time","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Friendly-Card-Expanded/dp/B0017SV1OI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sheena Easton","title":"Modern Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00353ATD2"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"All Those Years Ago","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BV6454X7"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Bette Davis Eyes","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001IVN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Air Supply","title":"The One That You Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Best-Air-Supply-Ones-That/dp/B000PLCMPK"},{"artist":"Hall & Oates","title":"You Make My Dreams Come True","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056CCH/ctoc"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"Being With You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Being-You-SMOKEY-ROBINSON/dp/B00DY9X0O2"},{"artist":"Ray Parker Jr.","title":"A Woman Needs Love","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082BHS772"},{"artist":"Gino Vannelli","title":"Living Inside Myself","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004LH1VYC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66624b6c36ec2edcf3b0feea","%2F66624d4136ec2edcf3b0fef9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/horror movies","keywords/Boris Karloff","keywords/remote viewing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666d9fdf8c900a6b6f1557e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da4ff8c900a6b6f1557f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da60f8c900a6b6f15580","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6666da6ef8c900a6b6f15581","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - FEBRUARY 25:  Sara Karloff, daughter of the famous actor Boris Karloff, stands in front of an oversized version of the \"Makeup\" stamp that pictures Karloff in thre role of Frankenstein's monster after the final ballot mailing ceremony of the 75th Anniversary Academy Awards February 25, 2003 in Beverly Hills, California.

In the first half, he delved into conspiracy theories and why people are drawn to them. While this kind of thinking dates back to early civilizations, nowadays, such theories rapidly spread on the Internet, and many followers/believers can be gained in short order. &quot;Anomaly hunters&quot; search through every photo and video, focusing on minutia, weird shadows, and things that don't seem to fit. The recent assassination attempt on Trump is an example of that, he said, though he conceded in this case, there actually are a &quot;number of anomalies and peculiarities that are going to have to be addressed.&quot; Perhaps it just boils down to incompetence on the part of the Secret Service or law enforcement, Shermer added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>We all believe some conspiracy theories, and that's a good thing because some of them are real, he noted, such as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Iran Contra, and MK-ULTRA, the CIA mind control program. On the topic of ET visitation, he doubts aliens have visited Earth, though he does believe it's likely that extraterrestrial life exists out there, and he is affiliated with Avi Loeb's \u003ca href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home\" target=\"_blank\">Galileo Project\u003c/a> in that regard. He also touched on alien abductions, and the malleability of memory, such as when people are recovering memories via hypnosis. Shermer has concluded that alien abductions are likely related to sleep paralysis episodes, where the dark figures that appear to those in a quasi-dream state are interpreted as menacing ETs, whereas in past eras, they were identified as demons or devils.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and medium \u003ca href=\"http://susangrau.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Grau\u003c/a> talked about dying, her near-death experience (NDE), angel encounters, and how a greater understanding of the afterlife can help us connect with our loved ones who have passed on. Her NDE at an early age had a profound impact on her views of spirituality and the afterlife. During the experience, she traveled to various locations, including a room of knowledge, a room of companions, and a &quot;yellow brick road&quot; that represented the path of one's journey. She also experienced a vision of unconditional love on a mountain, in which she saw a beatific being that was like a &quot;beam of light&quot; who made her feel complete and perfect.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the subject of grief for our lost loved ones, she emphasized that there is no time limit for it as it's directly related to the love for the person who has passed, and yet the knowledge that they continue on in spirit can be a comfort. When people die, they are never alone, she said, as there is someone on the Other Side, as well as angels, to greet them or come get them. There's nothing to fear about the spirit world, as it's where we come from and where we return, she pointed out. As to what to expect in the afterlife, she portrayed the realm as pulsating, vibrant, and beautiful with indescribable colors.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

of Skeptic magazine, \u003ca href=\"https://michaelshermer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Shermer\u003c/a>, holds a PhD in the history of science from Claremont and was a monthly columnist for Scientific American for 18 years. In the first half, he delved into conspiracy theories and why people are drawn to them. While this kind of thinking dates back to early civilizations, nowadays, such theories rapidly spread on the Internet, and many followers/believers can be gained in short order. &quot;Anomaly hunters&quot; search through every photo and video, focusing on minutia, weird shadows, and things that don't seem to fit. The recent assassination attempt on Trump is an example of that, he said, though he conceded in this case, there actually are a &quot;number of anomalies and peculiarities that are going to have to be addressed.&quot; Perhaps it just boils down to incompetence on the part of the Secret Service or law enforcement, Shermer added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>We all believe some conspiracy theories, and that's a good thing because some of them are real, he noted, such as the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Iran Contra, and MK-ULTRA, the CIA mind control program. On the topic of ET visitation, he doubts aliens have visited Earth, though he does believe it's likely that extraterrestrial life exists out there, and he is affiliated with Avi Loeb's \u003ca href=\"https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo/home\" target=\"_blank\">Galileo Project\u003c/a> in that regard. He also touched on alien abductions, and the malleability of memory, such as when people are recovering memories via hypnosis. Shermer has concluded that alien abductions are likely related to sleep paralysis episodes, where the dark figures that appear to those in a quasi-dream state are interpreted as menacing ETs, whereas in past eras, they were identified as demons or devils.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and medium \u003ca href=\"http://susangrau.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Susan Grau\u003c/a> talked about dying, her near-death experience (NDE), angel encounters, and how a greater understanding of the afterlife can help us connect with our loved ones who have passed on. Her NDE at an early age had a profound impact on her views of spirituality and the afterlife. During the experience, she traveled to various locations, including a room of knowledge, a room of companions, and a &quot;yellow brick road&quot; that represented the path of one's journey. She also experienced a vision of unconditional love on a mountain, in which she saw a beatific being that was like a &quot;beam of light&quot; who made her feel complete and perfect.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the subject of grief for our lost loved ones, she emphasized that there is no time limit for it as it's directly related to the love for the person who has passed, and yet the knowledge that they continue on in spirit can be a comfort. When people die, they are never alone, she said, as there is someone on the Other Side, as well as angels, to greet them or come get them. There's nothing to fear about the spirit world, as it's where we come from and where we return, she pointed out. As to what to expect in the afterlife, she portrayed the realm as pulsating, vibrant, and beautiful with indescribable colors.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He talked about his fascination with an ancient civilization that lived in the Indus Valley in northwestern India-- from satellite footage, it appears there were well-designed cities with regular drainage systems and organized streets that may have existed there between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago. Their script or language has yet to be deciphered, he noted. Cremo also delved into his study of Vedic wisdom, and consciousness and the idea that it is distinct from matter.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ancient Sanskrit texts describe advanced spacecraft called vimanas with what we might consider extraterrestrial technology, as the descriptions conform to modern UFO observations, he cited. While the Sanskrit writings date back about 5,000 years, they detailed events that occurred thousands or even millions of years ago, Cremo marveled. What's caught his interest lately are reports of huge megalithic stone pots in various parts of South Asia and Indonesia. On the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, there are elaborately carved pots nine or ten feet tall, and in Laos, there is an area called the &quot;Plain of Jars,&quot; which contains thousands of them. &quot;So apparently, there was either some race of giants or some very advanced technology having been mastered by the people in those areas years ago,&quot; he remarked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Former technology journalist \u003ca href=\"http://nickcook.works/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Cook\u003c/a> is well-known for his non-fiction book, The Hunt For Zero Point. In the latter half, he discussed his research into classified military aircraft and their connection to UFOs, as well as anti-gravity technology, and his most recent area of focus, the survival of consciousness after death. As the aerospace editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, he studied numerous black programs, including so-called stealth and hypersonic craft, like the legendary Aurora. Classified aircraft programs were often obscured and confused with UFO sightings, as it served the government's interests to keep these advanced technologies secret, he pointed out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His investigations into anti-gravity technology took him everywhere, from Area 51 to former Nazi German secret WWII installations. The Nazi scientist Hans Kammler likely defected to the US, and may have been involved in developing a secret propulsion program, Cook revealed. In 2021, he entered Robert Bigelow's \u003ca href=\"https://www.bigelowinstitute.org/index.php/about-bics/\" target=\"_blank\">BICS\u003c/a> essay contest and won a prize. He then worked with BICS as a part-time research director on the issue of 'the survival of consciousness.'

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

She defined the four &quot;clairs&quot; — clairvoyance, clairaudience, claircognizance, and clairsentience — as abilities that expand a person's sight, hearing, knowledge, and perception respectively. &quot;I had psychic phenomenon and intuitive stuff happen when I was a child, and then as I got older… these pathways started to open up for me,&quot; she recalled. According to her, the four &quot;clairs&quot; are like a car's GPS. &quot;It's hardwired to you, and it really course corrects,&quot; she explained, adding that there is a clear difference between psychic intuition and paranoia. Carroll Richardson described intuition as being less emotionally charged than overwhelming feelings like anxiety. &quot;You hear the gentle voice in your mind [and] the voice will always sound calm,&quot; she said. &quot;It won't necessarily feel like anxiety or panic, but it could feel like this strong nudge or gut instinct.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also detailed in depth the phenomena of soulmates and Twin Flames. Soulmates, she explained, are people with a strong spiritual connection to each other, and their paths cross for a reason. &quot;It could be a romantic interest… a pet… some family members [with whom] you might feel a much stronger soul connection than others,&quot; she claimed. This concept is different from a Twin Flame, which is a soul divided between two people and no one else. Carroll Richardson told listeners about how this idea dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. She mentioned how Twin Flames can sometimes be complementary opposites, such as an optimist and a pessimist who balance each other's energies. While admitting she hadn't seen the Netflix documentary Escaping Twin Flames, she acknowledged the mental traps people fall into when they don't understand this phenomenon. The seductive idea of finding your perfect match can have its downsides, she warned, describing how &quot;you can get so idealistic about it that you might think [someone] just doesn't fit... and you could miss out on a lovely partner.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A strong connection to a person, place, or event is what Carroll Richardson calls a soul contract. &quot;The idea is that something is laid down ahead of time and that we are going to have these experiences,&quot; she emphasized. One of her most amazing soul-contract experiences involved seeing an angel, which appeared to her one day while writing. &quot;I had a mirror that was over my desk,&quot; she recounted, &quot;and I looked up to see behind me, and my whole body just froze and went into fear.&quot; Though she witnessed a benevolent being, she couldn't help feeling frightened by such an awe-inspiring sight. &quot;I understood in the Bible why angels always tell people, 'Fear not,' because it can be very hysteric to see.&quot; Carroll Richardson also insisted that angels are non-denominational creatures, helping people of all faiths who need their assistance.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, listeners called in for Open Lines. Joshua from Idaho talked about meeting his soulmate when he and she were just 14 years old. When the two teens were hanging out, he told her about a hologram of Jesus he saw on a car trip, and she said she had seen the exact same thing. They were connected not only by this experience, but also by each other's old family photos where both were captured in the background. They are still together 36 years later.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>James in Newport, Virginia called in to challenge the idea of reincarnation, citing verses in the Bible that refute this view of the afterlife. Joe on the Wildcard Line discussed his experience meeting an angel, and said one needs to be open to the idea in order to witness it. Firefighter Jared shared the time he spoke with an angel who asked him if he was ready to die after an accident. He told the angel that he hadn't seen his son grow up and wasn't ready to go.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Nicole from San Diego phoned in to talk about the interconnectedness of creation and the planet's transformative energies. She also mentioned a generational curse that has prevented her from holding onto soulmates. Brad from California raised the question of psychic abilities existing within the autism spectrum. He claimed to have sensed a friend's internal injuries that no one else had yet detected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cornelius from Louisiana called in to pray for the people of Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl. Kenneth in Alabama also discussed meeting his soulmate in the Mojave Desert, far away from both their hometowns. They have been together for 39 years. Hope in North Carolina stressed the importance of empathy in the modern world. She also claimed that many of the new medical diagnoses are misinterpretations of new abilities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dave in Idaho also shared his soulmate story. He met her in a coffee shop and was struck by her beautiful eyes after she adjusted her glasses. One night, while out at a cabin, a blazing meteor appeared right after he told her he loved her. They have been married now for 30 years. Caleb from Chicago believed his call was predestined based on the previous callers and his connection to their stories.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>First-time caller Lynn in Los Angeles shared her psychic experiences in the 1970s.  She partook in a past-life regression exercise that transported her to England, where she saw a specific bakery burning down in her mind's eye. A fellow participant from London was able to confirm details about the city that Lynn recalled.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Empath-Heart-Relationship-Strategies-Sensitive/dp/1454946881/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Empath Heart: Relationship Strategies for Sensitive People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grief-Grace-Healing-Oracle-Guidebook/dp/1647229766/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Grief, Grace, and Healing: Oracle Deck and Guidebook\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Are-You-Earth-Angel-Understand/dp/073876292X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Are You an Earth Angel?\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Van Halen","title":"Love Walks In","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002CO1YD4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002CO1YD4"},{"artist":"The Bangles","title":"Eternal Flame","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137XDLM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137XDLM"},{"artist":"Leona Lewis","title":"Bleeding Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013G2U58/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Peter Gabriel","title":"In Your Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07D1GKBQS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07D1GKBQS"},{"artist":"The Killers","title":"All These Things That I've Done","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08F6R2H94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08F6R2H94"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Burning Down the House","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001OB2I3Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001OB2I3Q"},{"artist":"Queen","title":"Who Wants To Live Forever","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B017JXSZKC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B017JXSZKC"},{"artist":"R.E.M.","title":"The One I Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TRQBKW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TRQBKW"},{"artist":"Rush","title":"Entre Nous","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1YZIU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W1YZIU"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"Telephone Line","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136RNQO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136RNQO"},{"artist":"Phil Collins","title":"Take Me Home","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01CBIIVHC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01CBIIVHC"},{"artist":"Cheap Trick","title":"The Flame","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0081O9XRI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0081O9XRI"},{"artist":"Mad Season","title":"River of Deceit","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00BBRR3GA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00BBRR3GA"},{"artist":"Beck","title":"Up All Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B074X8GYR8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B074X8GYR8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e022878537fd678a3ecfbcb","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/angels","keywords/soulmates","keywords/Twin Flame"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6692625bc05ffb886c77cd50","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6692626ec05ffb886c77cd51","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6692627fc05ffb886c77cd52","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66926291c05ffb886c77cd53","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Graves at the historic East Perth Cemetery.\n\nEast Perth, Western Australia\n\n11th December 2021","id":"%2F66871565553793f45d596b39","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66871565553793f45d596b39","source_credit":"Robbie Goodall / Moment / Getty Images","title":"Angel looking down on a graves at a cemetery","url":"asset://assets.getty/66871565553793f45d596b39","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1720792800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-07-12-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://tanyablessings.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tanya Carroll Richardson\u003c/a> discussed psychic pathways, Twin Flames, soulmates, soul contracts, and angels.

In the novel, a family is drawn to a mysterious house, and the house draws them in. &quot;You're not sure if the house is trying to help them or destroy them,&quot; Jason remarked. The house that inspired the novel was a fixer-upper the Halberts bought in California. During a remodeling, they discovered old magazine clippings from the 1940s hidden in the wall, and many of the ads with women had their limbs scribbled out or cut off. They also found clothing with the arms and legs cut out. They noticed that grass wouldn't grow on the property, and no animals ever came into the yard. Eventually, the home became the site for an open murder case from the 1940s, as bloodstains were found in the hidden materials, Rhonda revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She recounted the eerie and disturbing time that she and her young son both heard someone in the house, though they knew just the two of them were there. On another occasion, both her son and daughter reported upon waking that they'd had the same dream about a creepy man. For Jason, these weren't his first encounters with the paranormal. Growing up in Texas, he was tormented by poltergeist phenomena, demonic activity, and horrible dreams he shared with my brother. &quot;We've come to learn and believe that...certain locations are definitely tied...to paranormal activity happening,&quot; he noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://michaeltellinger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Tellinger\u003c/a> is an author, explorer, and humanitarian who has made groundbreaking discoveries about advanced vanished civilizations at the southern tip of Africa. In the latter half, he updated his ongoing research into the mysterious stone circles and &quot;Adam's Calendar&quot; in South Africa (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/photos-adams-calendar-stone-circles/\" target=\"_blank\">view related images\u003c/a>). The stone circles could be as recent as 12,000 years old, though some may date back hundreds of thousands of years earlier, he said. The odd structures have no doorways and entrances, so they do not appear to have been used for shelter, and by Tellinger's estimate, there may be as many as 10 million of them spread out over South Africa and Zimbabwe. He has concluded the stones have magnetic and electromagnetic properties as part of an advanced technology that creates strong frequencies and fields and were networked together to generate vast amounts of energy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Further, he suggested that the Anunnaki, or advanced civilization/ETs that created the technology, may have done so in order to change Earth's climate, possibly to make it more habitable for them. Adam's Calendar, an ancient archaeological site, appears to have functioned as a kind of sun calendar, yet Tellinger believes it may also have generated unique energy, to possibly power the gold mining operations of the Anunnaki (the site is adjacent to an ancient gold mine). He also spoke about his efforts to keep his \u003ca href=\"https://www.michaeltellinger.com/museum-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">Stone Circle Museum\u003c/a> going, as well as the non-profit initiative \u003ca href=\"https://www.onesmalltown.org/\" target=\"_blank\">One Small Town\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caretaker-Goodpasture-Chronicles-R-J-Halbert/dp/1963366042/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Caretaker (The Goodpasture Chronicles)\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Slave-Species-Gods-History-Anunnaki/dp/1591431514/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Slave Species of the Gods\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/African-Temples-Anunnaki-Technologies-Mines/dp/1591431506/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">African Temples of the Anunnaki: The Lost Technologies of the Gold Mines of Enki\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Adams-Calendar-Discovering-man-made-structure/dp/1920153071/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Adam's Calendar\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"Neil Sedaka","title":"Breaking Up is Hard to Do","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07DFK3JWY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07DFK3JWY"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Little By Little","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122JZL0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122JZL0"},{"artist":"The Smiths","title":"How Soon Is Now","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KPUZ90/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KPUZ90"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox and the Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K60G4CQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K60G4CQ"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Frank Zappa","title":"Peaches En Regalia","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00B2Z1G1Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00B2Z1G1Y"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Material Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00122HJ40"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"TNT For the Brain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IULEEPC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Nat King Cole","title":"A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007MU96GU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007MU96GU"},{"artist":"Allman Brothers","title":"Jessica","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GJ1R79G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GJ1R79G"},{"artist":"Gary Wright","title":"Love is Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002FTD4YI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002FTD4YI"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return to Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCZ0G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCZ0G"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1S7YI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W1S7YI"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F668700e8f5b1e7593f12616e","%2F6686ffa83febbff80664b6a6","%2F5e002fa4cc137bf2442017c7"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/dark forces","keywords/music industry"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910b9c2a8b75f321471bf9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910baa2a8b75f321471bfa","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910bb82a8b75f321471bfb","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910bc62a8b75f321471bfc","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Cangas de Onís.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he argued on behalf of a new paradigm-- that the mind is separate from the brain. Certain practices and phenomena like precognition, remote viewing, OBEs, NDEs, and telepathy support the notion of an expansive, non-local mind that exists in a hyper-dimensional space, he stated. Matzke characterized the universe as a &quot;hyper big cloud&quot; of informational and computational systems, existing before the Big Bang. During paranormal phenomena like telepathy, the mind is connecting with that cloud, he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The notion that our mind is much more powerful than our brain, and even the limits of time and space, leads to the realization that we have much more control over our existence, he indicated. As such, he does not believe that AI will ever lead to general intelligence like in humans, as there is no mechanism for meaning. Matzke shared his hyper-dimensional model of &quot;bit-physics&quot;: Infinite sets of bit-vectors form the simulation infrastructure for all of our physical universe and all of the virtual universe of our minds.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://rviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul H. Smith\u003c/a> served for seven years in the government's Star Gate remote viewing psychic espionage program. In the latter half, he discussed the &quot;Father of Remote Viewing,&quot; Ingo Swann, and Ingo's work remote viewing the far side of the Moon. Smith recalled being trained by Swann in the remote viewing protocols he set up, which included being given a target, writing down what the mind sees, and making sketches of it. The CIA, though not necessarily believing in its validity, became interested in the remote viewing program after discovering the Russians were spending a lot of money on ESP research, Smith noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Swann became fascinated by what is known as transient lunar phenomena (anomalous lights and color changes) which led him to remote view the Moon, and Smith was tasked with this target as well. One of the things that was jointly reported by Smith, Swann, and a third remote viewer, without any communication between them, was the location of a tunnel &quot;that went down into the Moon...and into a huge chamber or cavern underneath that was partially natural, but had been engineered and expanded through some artificial means,&quot; he revealed.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He attributed a number of ailments, including tinnitus and atrial fibrillation, to osteoporosis of the skull and noted that each of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves may be associated with different symptoms. He recommends a diet free of fried foods, processed meats, oils, gluten, and sugar to help avoid this.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Doc Wallach, a proponent of using colloidal silver drops to fend off colds and infections, is currently focused on combating metabolic syndrome. He believes this syndrome, which is associated with abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, and heart disease, is primarily brought on by nutritional deficiencies. His view challenges the mainstream medical position that it's more related to genetics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Inspired by his own experiences with the unknown, \u003ca href=\"https://strangerbridgerland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Olsen\u003c/a> has spent 30 years interviewing and documenting stories of those who have witnessed the strange and unusual in the western United States. In the latter half, he shared his latest firsthand accounts of ghosts, hauntings, cryptids, UFOs, and unexplained phenomena, with a particular focus on reports from Utah. One such tale came from a man who said his father had been an archaeologist/professor for a Utah university, and when they were on an Anasazi tribe dig near the Four Corners area, if the team stayed too late, they would see huge orbs of light that would basically chase them out of the area. One night, the archaeologist was by himself at the site and heard heavy footsteps following him back to his car. The next day, the team discovered enormous wolf tracks from the dig site to the professor's car. The wolf tracks extended out into the desert, and as team members followed them, they were astonished to see them change into a barefoot human track.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Another fascinating account Olsen shared concerned a man who grew up in the Salt Lake Valley, and as a young boy, he would see a doppelganger of himself appear on the playground and in different places, and this was often the harbinger of a death in the family. He found out later that he had a twin that died when he was born, and wondered if it was the spirit of his brother he was seeing. But in working with a psychic, he learned that the doppelganger was actually a negative entity that attached itself to him and used the illusion of a doppelganger. Another story from a person's childhood concerned a woman who grew up in an abusive home, but whenever her father came home drunk, an elderly woman would show up and take her by the hand and hide her in the back of the closet, saving her from her father's wrath. It was only later, as the girl grew older that she realized that the woman was not a family member and her appearance was inexplicable.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://home.solari.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Catherine Austin Fitts\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

class="content-block type-html"><div class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, independent journalist&nbsp;<a href="https://thompsonatlarge.com/" target="_blank">Keith Thompson</a>&nbsp;joined host <a href="https://www.strangeplanet.ca/" target="_blank">Richard Syrett</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/richardsyrett" target="_blank">Twitter</a>) to discuss UFO sightings and other paranormal experiences. Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. "Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified," he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. "These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms," he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. "The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness," Thompson admitted.</p>

<p>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being "taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture." Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. "I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos," he said. "We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self." Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.</p>

<p>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. "What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance," he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. "Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads," he said, "and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems." The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the "Tic Tac" UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.</p>

<p>------------------------------</p>

<p>In the second half, <a href="https://speakerlynette.com/" target="_blank">Lynette Hill</a>&nbsp;detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.</p>

<p>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. "I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home," she said.</p>

<p>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as "so ingrained in Western medicine." Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.</p>

<p>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls "going back to Eden" — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. "[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it," Hill insisted. "And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit," she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.</p>

<p>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. "I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed," she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. "I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's," Hill said.</p>

the first half, independent journalist \u003ca href=\"https://thompsonatlarge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Keith Thompson\u003c/a> joined host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Syrett\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u003c/a>) to discuss UFO sightings and other paranormal experiences. Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory.

According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

How many hosts get off the air after a four hour show, turn on another microphone, and talk to fellow Ham operators around the country? How many talk hosts have the engineering know-how to produce their own show, run their own technical board, and generally control the ebb and flow of the show from the first on- air minute to the last? Art Bell's grasp of the electronic revolution--and how to make it personal--is unique; he's a talk show host primed to influence 21st century America in more ways than one.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Although there's something distinctly &quot;new century&quot; about the Art Bell mystique, Art's upbringing was unusually traditional. The son of a Marine Colonel father and a Drill Sergeant mother, Art developed a taste for news and analysis at an early age; he knew that current events could have a significant--and immediate--impact on his life; the family could be re- stationed for the slightest geopolitical reason. Art made a point of staying tuned into world events--in other words, he became a news junkie.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>By the age of 13, Art was an FCC licensed radio technician. A few years later, as a young airman, Bell and an equally foolhardy buddy built their own pirate radio station right on Amarillo Air Force base, secretly broadcasting rock 'n' roll to appreciative locals. These kinds of antics were not limited to bootleg military radio. As a civilian DJ, Art Bell landed in the Guinness Book of Records for a 116 hour (and 15 minutes) solo broadcast marathon &quot;playing the hits&quot; on KSBK on Okinawa, Japan. Then he raised money in Alaska that allowed Art to charter a DC 8, fly to Vietnam and rescue 130 Vietnamese Orphans stranded in Saigon at the war's end. They were eventually all brought to America and adopted by American families. Art's no-nonsense demeanor doesn't fool his listeners who sense he's more complex underneath.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Art Bell's political views are complex as well. He spent years on the island of Okinawa, living a Japanese lifestyle and working for KSBK, the only English speaking station in Asia; it gave him a Pacific Rim perspective and a grasp of international affairs that few talk show hosts really have. That plus his military background and his love of the news, made Art Bell a natural talk show host, a man who understood how politics, human nature, and cultural dynamics can affect national and international stability for better or for worse.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Art became immersed in the high tech world of cable television, eventually leaving radio to be part of building what became known as &quot;Prime Cable.&quot; As Chief Engineer for Times Mirror in Las Vegas, Art was on the fast track. His radio life had faded but not his radio love; before long Art was back at a microphone. When the 50 thousand watt giant in Las Vegas, KDWN offered him the chance to broadcast all night to 13 Western states, he grabbed the opportunity and never looked back.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Later, a chance to go network opened up and Chancellor Broadcasting Company was created. But that presented a new challenge when it came to the radio world. Nobody thought all-night live radio had a future after Larry King abandoned his throne. Advertisers thought no one would listen anymore. &quot;Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell&quot; proved them wrong, and now proudly a part of Premiere Radio Networks, Art Bell is back hosting the weekend version of Coast to Coast.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Art connects to his audience not just by the full force of modern technology from satellite to Internet to fax, but also by his unique view of the world, and a daring to pose all questions, no matter what the answer. When Art flips that switch and says &quot;from the high desert and the great American Southwest,&quot; he's talking to millions of Americans who want to be part of a unique experience.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>If you've ever sat in a darkened cockpit, in front of a twinkling control panel, and prepared for a night flight, you know the feel of what all-night radio can be like--the excitement of knowing that you'll be flying high and covering great distances while others are asleep. On &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; Art Bell is at the controls, guiding his millions of national listeners through the night's news, and bringing them in for a safe landing by dawn. That's Art Bell, and that's the Art Bell show. His fans know the feeling very well.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"#\" target=\"_self\">About Coast to Coast AM\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/art bell","keywords/host","keywords/Coast to Coast AM"]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"","id":"%2F5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0","title":"Art Bell","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0"}},"primary_video":{"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"author_name":"","author_url":"","height":0,"thumbnail_height":0,"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"title":"","width":0},"embed_type":"","html":"","provider":"","rendering_hint":"","url":""}},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"art-bell"},"source":{"type":"plain","value":""},"source_url":{"type":"plain","value":""},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Art Bell is no ordinary talk show host, not just because &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; is the dominant live all-night show in America today, but because Art's a true radio fanatic, the ultimate &quot;new media&quot; personality.\u003c/p>\n\n"},"title":{"type":"title","value":"Art Bell"}},"ingestion":{"external_url":"","feed_content_id":"","feed_permalink":"","feed_vendor":""},"summary":{"author":"","description":"Art Bell is no ordinary talk show host, not just because \"Coast to Coast AM\" is the dominant live all-night show in America today, but because Art's a true radio fanatic, the ultimate \"new media\" personality.","image":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"caption":"","link":"","new_tab":false,"title":"Art Bell","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0"},"keywords":["keywords/art bell","keywords/host","keywords/Coast to Coast AM"],"primary_slug":"art-bell","slugs":["art-bell"],"sponsored":false,"title":"Art Bell"},"targeting":{"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"publish_date":1565198700000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/COAST-PR (15194)","syndication":{"publish_origin":"","refs":{}},"targets":[{"id":"5d4b07230339baa33df2eb77","what":["coast-categories/host-art-bell"],"where":["brands/COAST-PR (15194)","collections/Coast to Coast AM","collections/Coast to Coast AM Host"]}]}},"pub_start":1565198700000,"type":"content:coast-to-coast-article","summary":{"title":"Art Bell","description":"Art Bell is no ordinary talk show host, not just because \"Coast to Coast AM\" is the dominant live all-night show in America today, but because Art's a true radio fanatic, the ultimate \"new media\" personality.","image":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0"}}]}}]}}],"resume":{"id":"ID:shows-collection-feed-whatwhere","context":{"\u003clocale>":"en-US","\u003cupcoming_pub_start>":1722377971000,"\u003cupcoming_pub_after>":1721170800000,"\u003cslug>":"2024-07-13-show"},"size":1,"from":"eyJza2lwIjoxLCJjdXJzb3JzIjp7Ijk0NzA3IjoiZXlKc2FXMXBkQ0k2TVN3aWIyWm1jMlYwSWpveGZRPT0ifSwiZW5kcyI6e319","scopes":[]}}},{"id":"b6UQ1","region":"right:dynamic","type":"feed","ordinal":1,"value":{"ad_split":null,"feed_id":"ID:articles-upcoming-shows-feed","feed_index":0,"position":null,"size":4,"title":""},"tags":["display-hints/coast-feed","display-hints/coast-upcoming-shows-preview"],"schedule":{"begin":0,"end":4115978604802},"feed":{"results":[{"id":"%2F669097ca9549d81f31bd1a7d","type":"PUBLISHING","record":{"ref_id":"%2F669097ca9549d81f31bd1a7d","type":"content:coast-to-coast-show","payload":{"canonical_url":"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/content/2024-07-19-show/","cuser":"user/ldap/PREBUR1SXN","fields":{"articles":{"type":"html","value":""},"author":{"type":"author","value":[]},"blocks":{"type":"flex","value":[{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://ruickbie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Leo Ruickbie\u003c/a> is a social scientist specializing in controversial beliefs and exceptional experiences.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

the first half, independent journalist \u003ca href=\"https://thompsonatlarge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Keith Thompson\u003c/a> joined host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Syrett\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u003c/a>) to discuss UFO sightings and other paranormal experiences. Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

the first half, independent journalist \u003ca href=\"https://thompsonatlarge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Keith Thompson\u003c/a> joined host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Syrett\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter\u003c/a>) to discuss UFO sightings and other paranormal experiences. Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained. She also noted the importance of making lifestyle changes across the board, not just a few dietary adjustments. &quot;I tell people you can't take what I call God's medicine and still go to McDonald's,&quot; Hill said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Disclaimer: Coast to Coast AM is not dispensing medical advice.

How many hosts get off the air after a four hour show, turn on another microphone, and talk to fellow Ham operators around the country? How many talk hosts have the engineering know-how to produce their own show, run their own technical board, and generally control the ebb and flow of the show from the first on- air minute to the last? Art Bell's grasp of the electronic revolution--and how to make it personal--is unique; he's a talk show host primed to influence 21st century America in more ways than one.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Although there's something distinctly &quot;new century&quot; about the Art Bell mystique, Art's upbringing was unusually traditional. The son of a Marine Colonel father and a Drill Sergeant mother, Art developed a taste for news and analysis at an early age; he knew that current events could have a significant--and immediate--impact on his life; the family could be re- stationed for the slightest geopolitical reason. Art made a point of staying tuned into world events--in other words, he became a news junkie.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>By the age of 13, Art was an FCC licensed radio technician. A few years later, as a young airman, Bell and an equally foolhardy buddy built their own pirate radio station right on Amarillo Air Force base, secretly broadcasting rock 'n' roll to appreciative locals. These kinds of antics were not limited to bootleg military radio. As a civilian DJ, Art Bell landed in the Guinness Book of Records for a 116 hour (and 15 minutes) solo broadcast marathon &quot;playing the hits&quot; on KSBK on Okinawa, Japan. Then he raised money in Alaska that allowed Art to charter a DC 8, fly to Vietnam and rescue 130 Vietnamese Orphans stranded in Saigon at the war's end. They were eventually all brought to America and adopted by American families. Art's no-nonsense demeanor doesn't fool his listeners who sense he's more complex underneath.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Art Bell's political views are complex as well. He spent years on the island of Okinawa, living a Japanese lifestyle and working for KSBK, the only English speaking station in Asia; it gave him a Pacific Rim perspective and a grasp of international affairs that few talk show hosts really have. That plus his military background and his love of the news, made Art Bell a natural talk show host, a man who understood how politics, human nature, and cultural dynamics can affect national and international stability for better or for worse.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Art became immersed in the high tech world of cable television, eventually leaving radio to be part of building what became known as &quot;Prime Cable.&quot; As Chief Engineer for Times Mirror in Las Vegas, Art was on the fast track. His radio life had faded but not his radio love; before long Art was back at a microphone. When the 50 thousand watt giant in Las Vegas, KDWN offered him the chance to broadcast all night to 13 Western states, he grabbed the opportunity and never looked back.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Later, a chance to go network opened up and Chancellor Broadcasting Company was created. But that presented a new challenge when it came to the radio world. Nobody thought all-night live radio had a future after Larry King abandoned his throne. Advertisers thought no one would listen anymore. &quot;Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell&quot; proved them wrong, and now proudly a part of Premiere Radio Networks, Art Bell is back hosting the weekend version of Coast to Coast.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Art connects to his audience not just by the full force of modern technology from satellite to Internet to fax, but also by his unique view of the world, and a daring to pose all questions, no matter what the answer. When Art flips that switch and says &quot;from the high desert and the great American Southwest,&quot; he's talking to millions of Americans who want to be part of a unique experience.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>If you've ever sat in a darkened cockpit, in front of a twinkling control panel, and prepared for a night flight, you know the feel of what all-night radio can be like--the excitement of knowing that you'll be flying high and covering great distances while others are asleep. On &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; Art Bell is at the controls, guiding his millions of national listeners through the night's news, and bringing them in for a safe landing by dawn. That's Art Bell, and that's the Art Bell show. His fans know the feeling very well.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"#\" target=\"_self\">About Coast to Coast AM\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/art bell","keywords/host","keywords/Coast to Coast AM"]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"","id":"%2F5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0","title":"Art Bell","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0"}},"primary_video":{"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"author_name":"","author_url":"","height":0,"thumbnail_height":0,"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"title":"","width":0},"embed_type":"","html":"","provider":"","rendering_hint":"","url":""}},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"art-bell"},"source":{"type":"plain","value":""},"source_url":{"type":"plain","value":""},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Art Bell is no ordinary talk show host, not just because &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; is the dominant live all-night show in America today, but because Art's a true radio fanatic, the ultimate &quot;new media&quot; personality.\u003c/p>\n\n"},"title":{"type":"title","value":"Art Bell"}},"ingestion":{"external_url":"","feed_content_id":"","feed_permalink":"","feed_vendor":""},"summary":{"author":"","description":"Art Bell is no ordinary talk show host, not just because \"Coast to Coast AM\" is the dominant live all-night show in America today, but because Art's a true radio fanatic, the ultimate \"new media\" personality.","image":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"caption":"","link":"","new_tab":false,"title":"Art Bell","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0"},"keywords":["keywords/art bell","keywords/host","keywords/Coast to Coast AM"],"primary_slug":"art-bell","slugs":["art-bell"],"sponsored":false,"title":"Art Bell"},"targeting":{"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"publish_date":1565198700000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/COAST-PR (15194)","syndication":{"publish_origin":"","refs":{}},"targets":[{"id":"5d4b07230339baa33df2eb77","what":["coast-categories/host-art-bell"],"where":["brands/COAST-PR (15194)","collections/Coast to Coast AM","collections/Coast to Coast AM Host"]}]}},"pub_start":1565198700000,"type":"content:coast-to-coast-article","summary":{"title":"Art Bell","description":"Art Bell is no ordinary talk show host, not just because \"Coast to Coast AM\" is the dominant live all-night show in America today, but because Art's a true radio fanatic, the ultimate \"new media\" personality.","image":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce0"}}]}}]}}],"resume":{"id":"ID:shows-collection-feed-whatwhere","context":{"\u003clocale>":"en-US","\u003cupcoming_pub_start>":1722377971000,"\u003cupcoming_pub_after>":1721170800000,"\u003cslug>":"2024-07-13-show"},"size":1,"from":"eyJza2lwIjoxLCJjdXJzb3JzIjp7Ijk0NzA3IjoiZXlKc2FXMXBkQ0k2TVN3aWIyWm1jMlYwSWpveGZRPT0ifSwiZW5kcyI6e319","scopes":[]}}},{"id":"b6UQ1","region":"right:dynamic","type":"feed","ordinal":1,"value":{"ad_split":null,"feed_id":"ID:articles-upcoming-shows-feed","feed_index":0,"position":null,"size":4,"title":""},"tags":["display-hints/coast-feed","display-hints/coast-upcoming-shows-preview"],"schedule":{"begin":0,"end":4115978604802},"feed":{"results":[{"id":"%2F669097ca9549d81f31bd1a7d","type":"PUBLISHING","record":{"ref_id":"%2F669097ca9549d81f31bd1a7d","type":"content:coast-to-coast-show","payload":{"canonical_url":"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/content/2024-07-19-show/","cuser":"user/ldap/PREBUR1SXN","fields":{"articles":{"type":"html","value":""},"author":{"type":"author","value":[]},"blocks":{"type":"flex","value":[{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://ruickbie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Leo Ruickbie\u003c/a> is a social scientist specializing in controversial beliefs and exceptional experiences.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, researcher \u003ca href=\"https://mcremo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Cremo\u003c/a> shared his explorations into forbidden archaeology and human origins, including artifacts and discoveries that don't fit into conventional timelines and theories of academic and scientific communities. He talked about his fascination with an ancient civilization that lived in the Indus Valley in northwestern India-- from satellite footage, it appears there were well-designed cities with regular drainage systems and organized streets that may have existed there between 5,000 and 6,000 years ago. Their script or language has yet to be deciphered, he noted. Cremo also delved into his study of Vedic wisdom, and consciousness and the idea that it is distinct from matter.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ancient Sanskrit texts describe advanced spacecraft called vimanas with what we might consider extraterrestrial technology, as the descriptions conform to modern UFO observations, he cited. While the Sanskrit writings date back about 5,000 years, they detailed events that occurred thousands or even millions of years ago, Cremo marveled. What's caught his interest lately are reports of huge megalithic stone pots in various parts of South Asia and Indonesia. On the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, there are elaborately carved pots nine or ten feet tall, and in Laos, there is an area called the &quot;Plain of Jars,&quot; which contains thousands of them. &quot;So apparently, there was either some race of giants or some very advanced technology having been mastered by the people in those areas years ago,&quot; he remarked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Former technology journalist \u003ca href=\"http://nickcook.works/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Cook\u003c/a> is well-known for his non-fiction book, The Hunt For Zero Point. In the latter half, he discussed his research into classified military aircraft and their connection to UFOs, as well as anti-gravity technology, and his most recent area of focus, the survival of consciousness after death. As the aerospace editor of Jane's Defence Weekly, he studied numerous black programs, including so-called stealth and hypersonic craft, like the legendary Aurora. Classified aircraft programs were often obscured and confused with UFO sightings, as it served the government's interests to keep these advanced technologies secret, he pointed out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His investigations into anti-gravity technology took him everywhere, from Area 51 to former Nazi German secret WWII installations. The Nazi scientist Hans Kammler likely defected to the US, and may have been involved in developing a secret propulsion program, Cook revealed.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Later, while studying philosophy in college, he realized the face looked almost exactly like an illustration of the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855).

Thompson claimed there's a paradox in people's understanding of extraterrestrial phenomena. According to him, these events are both physical and mental. &quot;Despite Western philosophy insisting that mind and matter are separated, there are experiences we've all had which indicate to us… that mind and matter are deeply unified,&quot; he explained. Thompson spoke of how someone can see the physical dimensions of an alien craft while also witnessing its transcendent qualities. &quot;These same craft will very often divide in two, change colors, change density, appear to be like holograms,&quot; he told listeners, adding that these objects are manipulating our mental states while also existing in the material world. &quot;The scientific method as it has been practiced… does not tell us what we need to know about the nature of consciousness,&quot; Thompson admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed his work with psychiatrist John Mack of Harvard University in drawing parallels between alien abductions and cultural rites of passage. He described these initiatory rites as someone being &quot;taken from the home, separated and taught the traditions of the culture.&quot; Thompson believes that certain abduction experiences, whether earthly or extraterrestrial, call on humans to expand their understanding and join a larger cosmic dialogue. &quot;I view UFO, paranormal phenomena, and near-death phenomena as a kind of metaphoric call from the cosmos,&quot; he said. &quot;We're being called by the cosmos to expand our maps of reality, our maps of science and society, and self.&quot; Thompson talked about a near-death experience he had while body surfing in Hawaii. After finding himself caught in a violent rip current and believing he was dying, he felt his spirit rise out of his body and psychically connect with a worried friend on the beach. Experiencing this area between life and death gave Thompson further proof that the physical and spiritual realms are interconnected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on the Catholic contemplative tradition, discussing the reports of practitioners levitating and displaying marks of the crucifixion known as stigmata, which resemble some of the physical markings on abductees. &quot;What did Ezekiel see? What was the burning bush [for Moses]? There are incidents in the Bible that are encounters not with UFOs, but with phenomena that are filled with light and fire and brilliance,&quot; he shared. Thompson believes there is overlap among many of these extraordinary experiences, but overall, he described himself as an empiricist. &quot;Let's follow the evidence wherever it leads,&quot; he said, &quot;and if it takes you beyond your belief systems, be willing to adjust your belief systems.&quot; The conversation's other subjects included the paranormal experiences of Emily Trim, David Grusch's UFO testimony, the persecution of Galileo for his revolutionary beliefs, the &quot;Tic Tac&quot; UFO sighting off the coast of San Diego, and many other topics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://speakerlynette.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lynette Hill\u003c/a> detailed her journey into the world of cancer, a true story that tested her strength in unimaginable and countless ways. Hill shared how in 2021, during the COVID-19 global pandemic, she was diagnosed with a 12-centimeter mass on her ovaries and bones. The doctors prescribed palliative care, not believing she had any chance of beating her illness. This news devastated her family, especially her five sons who had never seen her sick before.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her book Overcoming Cancer, she writes about how Thanksgiving Day in 2021 was a turning point for her. At a routine checkup, her vitals were so low that doctors and nurses were shocked she was still alive. Hill described how she was rushed to the ICU as her husband stood by, horrified. After a three-week stay in the hospital, she came home determined not to take any more chemotherapy pills. &quot;I didn't blame God. I wasn't angry. I was just surrendering to going home,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill shared with listeners how she always considered herself a person of faith, but her illness strengthened her connection to prayer. While talking to God and waiting to die, she found herself browsing the internet where she came across information about natural healing. She admitted that while she was drawn to the literature, she initially kept it from her family members whom she described as &quot;so ingrained in Western medicine.&quot; Hill had to filter out the snake-oil advertisements from the legitimate natural remedies, but one of the most compelling stories she found was from a man who healed his mother's breast cancer with turkey tail mushrooms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Consuming these potent plant medicines is what Hill calls &quot;going back to Eden&quot; — a return to what God created on this Earth. Other than turkey tail mushrooms, her favorite natural remedies include soursop leaves, apricot kernels, and black seed oil. Although there are some toxic chemicals in apricot kernels, Hill stated that this medicine works by targeting and killing only the cancerous cells. &quot;[The kernel is] also anti-parasitic. It's also anti-inflammatory. It has so many good things to it,&quot; Hill insisted. &quot;And if you notice now, speaking of seeds, the powers that be are removing all the seeds from the fruit,&quot; she continued, referencing watermelons and grapes in the grocery store.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hill recalled how she noticed her strength improve, and how her doctors were surprised to find the cancer fading away despite her not taking the chemotherapy medication. &quot;I knew that God had already healed me, even though, medically, they can't say I'm healed,&quot; she explained.

Soulmates, she explained, are people with a strong spiritual connection to each other, and their paths cross for a reason. &quot;It could be a romantic interest… a pet… some family members [with whom] you might feel a much stronger soul connection than others,&quot; she claimed. This concept is different from a Twin Flame, which is a soul divided between two people and no one else. Carroll Richardson told listeners about how this idea dates back to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato. She mentioned how Twin Flames can sometimes be complementary opposites, such as an optimist and a pessimist who balance each other's energies. While admitting she hadn't seen the Netflix documentary Escaping Twin Flames, she acknowledged the mental traps people fall into when they don't understand this phenomenon. The seductive idea of finding your perfect match can have its downsides, she warned, describing how &quot;you can get so idealistic about it that you might think [someone] just doesn't fit... and you could miss out on a lovely partner.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A strong connection to a person, place, or event is what Carroll Richardson calls a soul contract. &quot;The idea is that something is laid down ahead of time and that we are going to have these experiences,&quot; she emphasized. One of her most amazing soul-contract experiences involved seeing an angel, which appeared to her one day while writing. &quot;I had a mirror that was over my desk,&quot; she recounted, &quot;and I looked up to see behind me, and my whole body just froze and went into fear.&quot; Though she witnessed a benevolent being, she couldn't help feeling frightened by such an awe-inspiring sight. &quot;I understood in the Bible why angels always tell people, 'Fear not,' because it can be very hysteric to see.&quot; Carroll Richardson also insisted that angels are non-denominational creatures, helping people of all faiths who need their assistance.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, listeners called in for Open Lines. Joshua from Idaho talked about meeting his soulmate when he and she were just 14 years old. When the two teens were hanging out, he told her about a hologram of Jesus he saw on a car trip, and she said she had seen the exact same thing. They were connected not only by this experience, but also by each other's old family photos where both were captured in the background. They are still together 36 years later.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>James in Newport, Virginia called in to challenge the idea of reincarnation, citing verses in the Bible that refute this view of the afterlife. Joe on the Wildcard Line discussed his experience meeting an angel, and said one needs to be open to the idea in order to witness it. Firefighter Jared shared the time he spoke with an angel who asked him if he was ready to die after an accident. He told the angel that he hadn't seen his son grow up and wasn't ready to go.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Nicole from San Diego phoned in to talk about the interconnectedness of creation and the planet's transformative energies. She also mentioned a generational curse that has prevented her from holding onto soulmates. Brad from California raised the question of psychic abilities existing within the autism spectrum. He claimed to have sensed a friend's internal injuries that no one else had yet detected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cornelius from Louisiana called in to pray for the people of Houston in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl. Kenneth in Alabama also discussed meeting his soulmate in the Mojave Desert, far away from both their hometowns. They have been together for 39 years. Hope in North Carolina stressed the importance of empathy in the modern world. She also claimed that many of the new medical diagnoses are misinterpretations of new abilities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dave in Idaho also shared his soulmate story. He met her in a coffee shop and was struck by her beautiful eyes after she adjusted her glasses. One night, while out at a cabin, a blazing meteor appeared right after he told her he loved her. They have been married now for 30 years. Caleb from Chicago believed his call was predestined based on the previous callers and his connection to their stories.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>First-time caller Lynn in Los Angeles shared her psychic experiences in the 1970s.  She partook in a past-life regression exercise that transported her to England, where she saw a specific bakery burning down in her mind's eye. A fellow participant from London was able to confirm details about the city that Lynn recalled.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Empath-Heart-Relationship-Strategies-Sensitive/dp/1454946881/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Empath Heart: Relationship Strategies for Sensitive People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Grief-Grace-Healing-Oracle-Guidebook/dp/1647229766/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Grief, Grace, and Healing: Oracle Deck and Guidebook\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Are-You-Earth-Angel-Understand/dp/073876292X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Are You an Earth Angel?\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Van Halen","title":"Love Walks In","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002CO1YD4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002CO1YD4"},{"artist":"The Bangles","title":"Eternal Flame","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137XDLM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137XDLM"},{"artist":"Leona Lewis","title":"Bleeding Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013G2U58/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Peter Gabriel","title":"In Your Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07D1GKBQS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07D1GKBQS"},{"artist":"The Killers","title":"All These Things That I've Done","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08F6R2H94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08F6R2H94"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Burning Down the House","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001OB2I3Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001OB2I3Q"},{"artist":"Queen","title":"Who Wants To Live Forever","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B017JXSZKC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B017JXSZKC"},{"artist":"R.E.M.","title":"The One I Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TRQBKW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TRQBKW"},{"artist":"Rush","title":"Entre Nous","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1YZIU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W1YZIU"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"Telephone Line","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136RNQO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136RNQO"},{"artist":"Phil Collins","title":"Take Me Home","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01CBIIVHC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01CBIIVHC"},{"artist":"Cheap Trick","title":"The Flame","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0081O9XRI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0081O9XRI"},{"artist":"Mad Season","title":"River of Deceit","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00BBRR3GA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00BBRR3GA"},{"artist":"Beck","title":"Up All Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B074X8GYR8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B074X8GYR8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e022878537fd678a3ecfbcb","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/angels","keywords/soulmates","keywords/Twin Flame"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6692625bc05ffb886c77cd50","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6692626ec05ffb886c77cd51","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6692627fc05ffb886c77cd52","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66926291c05ffb886c77cd53","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Jul 12 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Graves at the historic East Perth Cemetery.\n\nEast Perth, Western Australia\n\n11th December 2021","id":"%2F66871565553793f45d596b39","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66871565553793f45d596b39","source_credit":"Robbie Goodall / Moment / Getty Images","title":"Angel looking down on a graves at a cemetery","url":"asset://assets.getty/66871565553793f45d596b39","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1720792800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-07-12-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://tanyablessings.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tanya Carroll Richardson\u003c/a> discussed psychic pathways, Twin Flames, soulmates, soul contracts, and angels.

During a remodeling, they discovered old magazine clippings from the 1940s hidden in the wall, and many of the ads with women had their limbs scribbled out or cut off. They also found clothing with the arms and legs cut out. They noticed that grass wouldn't grow on the property, and no animals ever came into the yard. Eventually, the home became the site for an open murder case from the 1940s, as bloodstains were found in the hidden materials, Rhonda revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She recounted the eerie and disturbing time that she and her young son both heard someone in the house, though they knew just the two of them were there. On another occasion, both her son and daughter reported upon waking that they'd had the same dream about a creepy man. For Jason, these weren't his first encounters with the paranormal. Growing up in Texas, he was tormented by poltergeist phenomena, demonic activity, and horrible dreams he shared with my brother. &quot;We've come to learn and believe that...certain locations are definitely tied...to paranormal activity happening,&quot; he noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://michaeltellinger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Tellinger\u003c/a> is an author, explorer, and humanitarian who has made groundbreaking discoveries about advanced vanished civilizations at the southern tip of Africa. In the latter half, he updated his ongoing research into the mysterious stone circles and &quot;Adam's Calendar&quot; in South Africa (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/photos-adams-calendar-stone-circles/\" target=\"_blank\">view related images\u003c/a>). The stone circles could be as recent as 12,000 years old, though some may date back hundreds of thousands of years earlier, he said. The odd structures have no doorways and entrances, so they do not appear to have been used for shelter, and by Tellinger's estimate, there may be as many as 10 million of them spread out over South Africa and Zimbabwe. He has concluded the stones have magnetic and electromagnetic properties as part of an advanced technology that creates strong frequencies and fields and were networked together to generate vast amounts of energy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Further, he suggested that the Anunnaki, or advanced civilization/ETs that created the technology, may have done so in order to change Earth's climate, possibly to make it more habitable for them. Adam's Calendar, an ancient archaeological site, appears to have functioned as a kind of sun calendar, yet Tellinger believes it may also have generated unique energy, to possibly power the gold mining operations of the Anunnaki (the site is adjacent to an ancient gold mine). He also spoke about his efforts to keep his \u003ca href=\"https://www.michaeltellinger.com/museum-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">Stone Circle Museum\u003c/a> going, as well as the non-profit initiative \u003ca href=\"https://www.onesmalltown.org/\" target=\"_blank\">One Small Town\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caretaker-Goodpasture-Chronicles-R-J-Halbert/dp/1963366042/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Caretaker (The Goodpasture Chronicles)\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Slave-Species-Gods-History-Anunnaki/dp/1591431514/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Slave Species of the Gods\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/African-Temples-Anunnaki-Technologies-Mines/dp/1591431506/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">African Temples of the Anunnaki: The Lost Technologies of the Gold Mines of Enki\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Adams-Calendar-Discovering-man-made-structure/dp/1920153071/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Adam's Calendar\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"Neil Sedaka","title":"Breaking Up is Hard to Do","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07DFK3JWY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07DFK3JWY"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Little By Little","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122JZL0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122JZL0"},{"artist":"The Smiths","title":"How Soon Is Now","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KPUZ90/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KPUZ90"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox and the Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K60G4CQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K60G4CQ"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Frank Zappa","title":"Peaches En Regalia","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00B2Z1G1Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00B2Z1G1Y"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Material Girl","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00122HJ40"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"TNT For the Brain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IULEEPC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Nat King Cole","title":"A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007MU96GU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007MU96GU"},{"artist":"Allman Brothers","title":"Jessica","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GJ1R79G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GJ1R79G"},{"artist":"Gary Wright","title":"Love is Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002FTD4YI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002FTD4YI"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return to Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCZ0G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCZ0G"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1S7YI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W1S7YI"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F668700e8f5b1e7593f12616e","%2F6686ffa83febbff80664b6a6","%2F5e002fa4cc137bf2442017c7"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/dark forces","keywords/music industry"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910b9c2a8b75f321471bf9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910baa2a8b75f321471bfa","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910bb82a8b75f321471bfb","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66910bc62a8b75f321471bfc","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Jul 11 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Cangas de Onís.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he argued on behalf of a new paradigm-- that the mind is separate from the brain. Certain practices and phenomena like precognition, remote viewing, OBEs, NDEs, and telepathy support the notion of an expansive, non-local mind that exists in a hyper-dimensional space, he stated. Matzke characterized the universe as a &quot;hyper big cloud&quot; of informational and computational systems, existing before the Big Bang. During paranormal phenomena like telepathy, the mind is connecting with that cloud, he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The notion that our mind is much more powerful than our brain, and even the limits of time and space, leads to the realization that we have much more control over our existence, he indicated. As such, he does not believe that AI will ever lead to general intelligence like in humans, as there is no mechanism for meaning. Matzke shared his hyper-dimensional model of &quot;bit-physics&quot;: Infinite sets of bit-vectors form the simulation infrastructure for all of our physical universe and all of the virtual universe of our minds.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://rviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul H. Smith\u003c/a> served for seven years in the government's Star Gate remote viewing psychic espionage program. In the latter half, he discussed the &quot;Father of Remote Viewing,&quot; Ingo Swann, and Ingo's work remote viewing the far side of the Moon. Smith recalled being trained by Swann in the remote viewing protocols he set up, which included being given a target, writing down what the mind sees, and making sketches of it. The CIA, though not necessarily believing in its validity, became interested in the remote viewing program after discovering the Russians were spending a lot of money on ESP research, Smith noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Swann became fascinated by what is known as transient lunar phenomena (anomalous lights and color changes) which led him to remote view the Moon, and Smith was tasked with this target as well. One of the things that was jointly reported by Smith, Swann, and a third remote viewer, without any communication between them, was the location of a tunnel &quot;that went down into the Moon...and into a huge chamber or cavern underneath that was partially natural, but had been engineered and expanded through some artificial means,&quot; he revealed. For more on Ingo's work, Smith referenced researcher Daz Smith's remote viewing magazine &quot;\u003ca href=\"http://www.eightmartinis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eight Martinis\u003c/a>,&quot; which has free online downloads.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Deep-Reality-Science-Understanding-Potential/dp/1949001733/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Reality: Why Source Science May Be the Key to Understanding Human Potential\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312875150/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Reading the Enemy's Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1938815017/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Essential Guide to Remote Viewing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLKJGE2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sammy Davis Jr. ","title":"Hey There","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DOF6RFA"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000062FZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It’s Worth","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002IAZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Jack-Rem"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Summer Wind","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002LOI/ctoc"},{"artist":"INXS","title":"Beautiful Girl","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066ROB/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enya","title":"Only Time","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000050XEI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Mea Culpa","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Mcmxc-D-Enigma/dp/B000002URV//ctoc"},{"artist":"Dean Martin","title":"Sway","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Dean-Martin-All-Time-Greatest-Hits/dp/B000000CX6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Dave Matthews Band","title":"Two Step","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002WYT/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Come Together","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002UB3/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Sadeness-Part-1-Enigma/dp/B000005JWS/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Love Her Madly","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002H22/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F627da950046e13836d1026cb","%2F5e0034a4537fd678a3ece911"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/physics","keywords/paranormal phenomena","keywords/Ingo Swann","keywords/remote viewing","keywords/dowsing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/668fbbd78b01e8263fce840d","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jul 10 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/668fbbe78b01e8263fce840e","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jul 10 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/668fbbf68b01e8263fce840f","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jul 10 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/668fbc058b01e8263fce8410","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jul 10 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Abstract background God's Eye - 3d rendered image from my background series \"Absolute\".

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He attributed a number of ailments, including tinnitus and atrial fibrillation, to osteoporosis of the skull and noted that each of the 12 pairs of cranial nerves may be associated with different symptoms. He recommends a diet free of fried foods, processed meats, oils, gluten, and sugar to help avoid this.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Doc Wallach, a proponent of using colloidal silver drops to fend off colds and infections, is currently focused on combating metabolic syndrome. He believes this syndrome, which is associated with abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, high blood pressure, and heart disease, is primarily brought on by nutritional deficiencies. His view challenges the mainstream medical position that it's more related to genetics.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Inspired by his own experiences with the unknown, \u003ca href=\"https://strangerbridgerland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Olsen\u003c/a> has spent 30 years interviewing and documenting stories of those who have witnessed the strange and unusual in the western United States. In the latter half, he shared his latest firsthand accounts of ghosts, hauntings, cryptids, UFOs, and unexplained phenomena, with a particular focus on reports from Utah. One such tale came from a man who said his father had been an archaeologist/professor for a Utah university, and when they were on an Anasazi tribe dig near the Four Corners area, if the team stayed too late, they would see huge orbs of light that would basically chase them out of the area. One night, the archaeologist was by himself at the site and heard heavy footsteps following him back to his car. The next day, the team discovered enormous wolf tracks from the dig site to the professor's car. The wolf tracks extended out into the desert, and as team members followed them, they were astonished to see them change into a barefoot human track.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Another fascinating account Olsen shared concerned a man who grew up in the Salt Lake Valley, and as a young boy, he would see a doppelganger of himself appear on the playground and in different places, and this was often the harbinger of a death in the family. He found out later that he had a twin that died when he was born, and wondered if it was the spirit of his brother he was seeing. But in working with a psychic, he learned that the doppelganger was actually a negative entity that attached itself to him and used the illusion of a doppelganger. Another story from a person's childhood concerned a woman who grew up in an abusive home, but whenever her father came home drunk, an elderly woman would show up and take her by the hand and hide her in the back of the closet, saving her from her father's wrath. It was only later, as the girl grew older that she realized that the woman was not a family member and her appearance was inexplicable.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://home.solari.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Catherine Austin Fitts\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

In the first half, he discussed the history of space exploration, and shared updates on SpaceX, and how the global race to space is shaping up. He characterized the International Space Station (ISS) as a disappointment in that it hasn't been used to help develop an interplanetary spaceship, though he believes NASA is on the right track moving towards private companies developing space technology and rockets. &quot;Right now, in the US alone, there are four commercial space stations being built privately,&quot; and this will create multiple options, not just to NASA or the US, but to many private companies who want to do research in space,&quot; he enthused.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Zimmerman highlighted SpaceX's achievements in developing the reusable rocket called Starship. It's the biggest rocket ever built and possibly more powerful than the Saturn V, and so far, most of its test flights have been very successful. But China, right now, has the best space program, he opined. They are conducting engineering research to build a ship that can take their astronauts to other worlds, and on top of that, they have done sample return missions to the Moon and have an orbiter around Mars. He also touched on the recent death of Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders, who flew on the first manned space mission to orbit the Moon. He died in a plane crash at age 90 while competing in antique plane racing. On the subject of Mars, Zimmerman commented that the Red Planet is not a desert world, and it won't be difficult for future colonists to find water there.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://jacoblcooper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob Cooper\u003c/a> is a clinical social worker, Reiki master, and certified hypnotherapist who specializes in past life regression therapy. In the latter half, he spoke about his near-death experience (NDE), grief, tools for spiritual well-being, and the synergy of mental health and spirituality. His NDE occurred when he was a young child, but it had a profound effect on him, and during the experience, he encountered a number of angels and spirit guides and realized he was a soul living in a child's body. The spirit guides, he explained, are with us before we get here and during every part of our lifetime-- &quot;they are just the innermost part of ourselves,&quot; and know everything about us at our deepest core.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cooper described God as an inner connection within oneself and all of life, rooted in an eternal creative force of love. There is a you that is beyond your body, thoughts, and emotions, but it is often hard for people to get beyond that barrier, he indicated. He advised practicing gratitude and seeing the beauty in everyday life. This &quot;god lens,&quot; or living each moment as a prayer, can increase your spiritual awareness and connection to the divine, he suggested. On the subject of grief, he noted that it's important to realize that our departed loved ones are not lost and still exist in another realm. &quot;When there's great love, we feel great loss, but eventually, when you're able to...allow yourself to feel what you feel, you can heal,&quot; he pointed out. And this can transform tragedy into meaning, &quot;and when you find meaning, you change from a victim of circumstances to a victor of your circumstances.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://theskylive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Steve Kates\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Conscious-Choice-Origins-Slavery-America/dp/1456639188/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Conscious Choice: The Origins of Slavery in America and Why it Matters Today and for Our Future in Outer Space\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://behindtheblack.com/books/capitalism-in-space/\" target=\"_blank\">Capitalism in Space\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Life-After-Breath-Fatality-Immortality/dp/1951805283/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Life After Breath: How a Brush with Fatality Gave Me a Glimpse of Immortality\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BT78M13Z/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Wisdom of Jacob's Ladder\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003Z2F/ctoc"},{"artist":"Brothers Four","title":"Green Leaves of Summer","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0000024RA/ctoc"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000000W6X/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Learning to Fly","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005QDW5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Time After Time","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005A1D4/ctoc"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028UW/ctoc"},{"artist":"Chambers Brothers","title":"Time Has Come Today","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002AFM/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return to Innocence","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"Harry Belafonte","title":"Turn Around","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01FL3BM6Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01FL3BM6Q"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Do it Again","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000002P4R/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday On My Mind","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003493/ctoc"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Beyond the Invisible","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Enigma-Love-Sensuality-Devotion-Greatest/dp/B00005OMTT/ctoc"},{"artist":"New Order","title":"Regret","url":"http://www.amazon.com/International-Best-New-Order/dp/B000088EBF/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfff415cc137bf2442014d6","%2F61847f300b6c03e9d277bb5a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/space race","keywords/space exploration","keywords/mental health","keywords/past lives"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/668d1827f54a5cc14a13d0e8","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jul 8 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/668d1836f54a5cc14a13d0e9","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jul 8 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/668d1842f54a5cc14a13d0ea","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jul 8 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/668d1850f54a5cc14a13d0eb","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jul 8 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"application/postscript","type":"document"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Human Space Colonisation Poster.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, bestselling author <a href="https://ernestcline.com/" target="_blank">Ernest Cline</a> joined George Knapp to discuss his thoughts on artificial intelligence and UFOs. He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;</p>

<p>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s" target="_blank">Readyverse</a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.</p>

<p>In the second half, journalist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/" target="_blank">Lissa Townsend Rodgers</a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;</p>

<p>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot; These are just a few of the tales of the fierce females mentioned in Townsend Rodgers's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shameless-Lissa-Townsend-Rodgers/dp/1944877614/ctoc" target="_blank">which you can find here</a>.</p>

the first half, bestselling author \u003ca href=\"https://ernestcline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Cline\u003c/a> joined George Knapp to discuss his thoughts on artificial intelligence and UFOs. He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot; These are just a few of the tales of the fierce females mentioned in Townsend Rodgers's book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shameless-Lissa-Townsend-Rodgers/dp/1944877614/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">which you can find here\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n"},{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"@provider":"YouTube","@query":"https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&omit_script=true&omitscript=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgnDIhyn7n2s","@url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s","author_name":"TheReadyverse","author_url":"https://www.youtube.com/@TheReadyverse","height":113,"html":"\u003ciframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnDIhyn7n2s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot;

He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot; These are just a few of the tales of the fierce females mentioned in Townsend Rodgers's book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shameless-Lissa-Townsend-Rodgers/dp/1944877614/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">which you can find here\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n"},{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"@provider":"YouTube","@query":"https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&omit_script=true&omitscript=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgnDIhyn7n2s","@url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s","author_name":"TheReadyverse","author_url":"https://www.youtube.com/@TheReadyverse","height":113,"html":"\u003ciframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnDIhyn7n2s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

She delved into the numbers of the presidential candidates and their new running mates. JD Vance has a '5' lifepath and needs to learn to let go of positions that aren't working for him, like his 'childless cat lady' comment, McCants suggested. Out of six numbers that people can match up with, Donald Trump shares three numbers with Vance, but they also have three numbers that are in challenge with each other, which means it's going to take work for them to get along. She found that Vice President Harris and Gov. Tim Walz also have three challenge numbers out of six. The election on November 5th, 2024, is a '5' day, and interestingly, all four candidates have a '5' in their numbers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also presented details on how people can find their Destiny Number, which is determined by adding up the numbers associated with their full birth name (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1023925905767363&set=a.230584731768155\" target=\"_blank\">see this chart\u003c/a> for the breakdown). She revealed that George Noory has 9/1/1 for his birth certificate name, which represents &quot;Who do they call for help?&quot; and a &quot;1&quot; Destiny Number, which means he strives to be the best at what he does. McCants shared an analysis of several American Olympians who have won gold medals: Swimmer Katie Ledecky's numerology blueprint highlights her competitive nature and alignment of energies for success, while gymnast Simone Biles, who is in a personal year of '7,' demonstrates the lesson of being one's best self, despite not being a '1' lifepath. During the last hour, she gave readings for callers.

After a severe bout of sepsis and paralysis that doctors warned was going to kill him within 48 hours, Spina not only healed himself but also became determined to share his technique with others, a testament to the transformative power of self-healing. He highlighted the non-linear nature of healing and the importance of reaching a still, meditative state for self-repair. He introduced his new book &quot;Access Super Consciousness,&quot; which offers 24 transformative meditations designed to facilitate personal growth and deeper awareness. He views meditation as the space between thoughts that occurs in the present moment, as opposed to thinking, which is always a rumination or a projection that deals with the past or future.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Spina delved into the concept of self-mastery, describing it as having dominion over one's body, mind, and energy, similar to Buddhist and Hindu practices. His insights suggest that meditation is not just a practice, but a gateway to deeper understanding and fulfillment, offering a path to both personal and collective transformation. He articulated a vision of spirituality as practical, suggesting that &quot;spirituality isn't worth anything if it isn't applicable in our day-to-day life.&quot; Rather than belief, he emphasized the importance of &quot;knowingness&quot; and self-awareness. He shared his profound personal experiences with energy healing, describing a moment of clarity when he could actually feel electricity, &quot;and that's when I knew I was onto something.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.strategicfinancialintelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John Truman Wolfe\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Numbers-Reignite-Through-Numerology/dp/1402224494/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Love by the Numbers\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401301428/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Glynis Has Your Number\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Access-Super-Consciousness-Frequency-Obstacles/dp/0738777137/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Access Super Consciousness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Supercharged-Self-Healing-Revolutionary-High-Frequency-Consciousness/dp/073876809X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharged Self-Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Deprogram-Subconscious/dp/0738774251/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Change Your Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003Z2F/ctoc"},{"artist":"Vic Damone","title":"All The Things You Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MAVXGCA/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137KSWE/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"N'Sync","title":"Bye Bye Bye","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002TTPR30/ctoc"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Procol Harum","title":"A Whiter Shade Of Pale","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BZX2L8C8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BZX2L8C8"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"The Sunny Side Of The Street","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KURQGBU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00KURQGBU"},{"artist":"Emerson, Lake, & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It’s Worth","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0011Z76UA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0011Z76UA"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"Once Upon A Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D4N94QH6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0D4N94QH6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dffe019cc137bf2442013d5","%2F6196fc77fcb032b8eb633b34"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/numerology","keywords/energy","keywords/healing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b4a3569ebcaed11eff2560","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Aug 7 2024 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed.

Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot;

the first half, bestselling author \u003ca href=\"https://ernestcline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Cline\u003c/a> joined George Knapp to discuss his thoughts on artificial intelligence and UFOs. He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot; These are just a few of the tales of the fierce females mentioned in Townsend Rodgers's book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shameless-Lissa-Townsend-Rodgers/dp/1944877614/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">which you can find here\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n"},{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"@provider":"YouTube","@query":"https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&omit_script=true&omitscript=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgnDIhyn7n2s","@url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s","author_name":"TheReadyverse","author_url":"https://www.youtube.com/@TheReadyverse","height":113,"html":"\u003ciframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnDIhyn7n2s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

the first half, bestselling author \u003ca href=\"https://ernestcline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ernest Cline\u003c/a> joined George Knapp to discuss his thoughts on artificial intelligence and UFOs. He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot; These are just a few of the tales of the fierce females mentioned in Townsend Rodgers's book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shameless-Lissa-Townsend-Rodgers/dp/1944877614/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">which you can find here\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n"},{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"@provider":"YouTube","@query":"https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&omit_script=true&omitscript=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgnDIhyn7n2s","@url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s","author_name":"TheReadyverse","author_url":"https://www.youtube.com/@TheReadyverse","height":113,"html":"\u003ciframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnDIhyn7n2s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot;

He wished listeners a happy Father's Day, saying that as a dad, he tries to remain optimistic about the future, even while facing the uncertain implications of rapidly evolving AI. Cline, whose book &quot;Ready Player One&quot; was developed into a major motion picture, spoke about how science fiction's alarming portrayals of AI are beginning to manifest. &quot;Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were warning us about artificial intelligence,&quot; he said. &quot;I think about [the film] 2001 and the thesis presented there, which is really just humans and their tools getting out of control.&quot; He shared his belief that AI might derive from alien intelligence, saying, &quot;Our military has been taking alien or non-human technology that they've recovered going back to Roswell, and maybe even before that.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline addressed how scientists and government officials have grown more interested in alien technology. Members of Congress are now pressing top military brass for answers about phenomena in US airspace, but Cline noted that these requests for classified information often hit a brick wall. &quot;I don't think they can come clean… because to come clean is to admit that they're not in control,&quot; he claimed. &quot;We can't control our own airspace, and that's mission failure.&quot; Despite all the red tape, he admitted that he's glad the conversation around UFOs and secretive technology is progressing. &quot;I think the genie's out of the bottle,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cline has also helped develop a digital gaming platform called \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s\" target=\"_blank\">Readyverse\u003c/a>, inspired by his novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;. He shared with listeners how he hopes this online space will foster communication and collaboration among sci-fi fans, saying that the metaverse allows people to &quot;recreate the fictional environments depicted in movies or in television shows… and then meet up inside these environments.&quot; Cline sees the metaverse as a new storytelling platform that transcends geographic limitations. &quot;These are the most interesting times to be alive,&quot; he claimed. To see a preview of the Readyverse, check out the video below.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lissatownsendrodgers/\" target=\"_blank\">Lissa Townsend Rodgers\u003c/a> spoke about some of the women crime bosses she profiled in her book &quot;Shameless: Women of the Underworld.&quot; She was inspired to give women in mob history a voice after realizing how little the public knew about them. &quot;I've always been interested in the people whose names you see mentioned, but nobody really tells you their story,&quot; she said. Living in Las Vegas exposed her to many tales of organized crime, which fueled her interest in the subject even more. She gave listeners insights about Bonnie Parker of the infamous duo Bonnie and Clyde, debunking myths and highlighting the couple's desperation and vulnerability. She emphasized Bonnie's intelligence, challenging the public's perception of her as a mere sidekick to Clyde. &quot;She was an incredibly bright woman… she was very good with media and image in a time when people didn't understand that,&quot; Townsend Rodgers stated while talking about the couple's legendary photographs. &quot;At a certain point, she recognized that they were going to be spoken about, and she wanted a say in it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Townsend Rodgers also talked about two other strong, flamboyant women from the criminal underworld: Virginia Hill and Stephanie St. Clair. Hill learned to stand up for herself at an early age, especially around her abusive father. &quot;She picked up a frying pan full of grease that was hot and hit him with it,&quot; Townsend Rodgers said. &quot;He never came near her again, and I feel like that was sort of a pivotal moment where she realized… that's how you're going to survive.&quot; Hill became a fixture at lavish New York night clubs where she met mobster Bugsy Siegel. According to Townsend Rodgers, &quot;She starts making a lot of money and suddenly [has] this opulent lifestyle… furs and mansions and cars, and she spends money like crazy.&quot; Her glamorous image captivated the public, who religiously tuned in to hear her televised testimony in front of the Kefauver Committee. Another crime boss, Stephanie St. Clair, came from humble beginnings in the French Caribbean but built a criminal enterprise around lotteries in Harlem, which were then known as &quot;numbers games.&quot; According to Townsend Rodgers, St. Clair stood up to notorious mobster Dutch Schultz when he moved in on her turf, smashing the windows of his storefronts and telling him, &quot;Harlem is for us.&quot; These are just a few of the tales of the fierce females mentioned in Townsend Rodgers's book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shameless-Lissa-Townsend-Rodgers/dp/1944877614/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">which you can find here\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n"},{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"@provider":"YouTube","@query":"https://www.youtube.com/oembed?format=json&omit_script=true&omitscript=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgnDIhyn7n2s","@url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnDIhyn7n2s","author_name":"TheReadyverse","author_url":"https://www.youtube.com/@TheReadyverse","height":113,"html":"\u003ciframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnDIhyn7n2s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

She delved into the numbers of the presidential candidates and their new running mates. JD Vance has a '5' lifepath and needs to learn to let go of positions that aren't working for him, like his 'childless cat lady' comment, McCants suggested. Out of six numbers that people can match up with, Donald Trump shares three numbers with Vance, but they also have three numbers that are in challenge with each other, which means it's going to take work for them to get along. She found that Vice President Harris and Gov. Tim Walz also have three challenge numbers out of six. The election on November 5th, 2024, is a '5' day, and interestingly, all four candidates have a '5' in their numbers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also presented details on how people can find their Destiny Number, which is determined by adding up the numbers associated with their full birth name (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1023925905767363&set=a.230584731768155\" target=\"_blank\">see this chart\u003c/a> for the breakdown). She revealed that George Noory has 9/1/1 for his birth certificate name, which represents &quot;Who do they call for help?&quot; and a &quot;1&quot; Destiny Number, which means he strives to be the best at what he does. McCants shared an analysis of several American Olympians who have won gold medals: Swimmer Katie Ledecky's numerology blueprint highlights her competitive nature and alignment of energies for success, while gymnast Simone Biles, who is in a personal year of '7,' demonstrates the lesson of being one's best self, despite not being a '1' lifepath. During the last hour, she gave readings for callers.

After a severe bout of sepsis and paralysis that doctors warned was going to kill him within 48 hours, Spina not only healed himself but also became determined to share his technique with others, a testament to the transformative power of self-healing. He highlighted the non-linear nature of healing and the importance of reaching a still, meditative state for self-repair. He introduced his new book &quot;Access Super Consciousness,&quot; which offers 24 transformative meditations designed to facilitate personal growth and deeper awareness. He views meditation as the space between thoughts that occurs in the present moment, as opposed to thinking, which is always a rumination or a projection that deals with the past or future.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Spina delved into the concept of self-mastery, describing it as having dominion over one's body, mind, and energy, similar to Buddhist and Hindu practices. His insights suggest that meditation is not just a practice, but a gateway to deeper understanding and fulfillment, offering a path to both personal and collective transformation. He articulated a vision of spirituality as practical, suggesting that &quot;spirituality isn't worth anything if it isn't applicable in our day-to-day life.&quot; Rather than belief, he emphasized the importance of &quot;knowingness&quot; and self-awareness. He shared his profound personal experiences with energy healing, describing a moment of clarity when he could actually feel electricity, &quot;and that's when I knew I was onto something.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.strategicfinancialintelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John Truman Wolfe\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Numbers-Reignite-Through-Numerology/dp/1402224494/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Love by the Numbers\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401301428/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Glynis Has Your Number\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Access-Super-Consciousness-Frequency-Obstacles/dp/0738777137/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Access Super Consciousness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Supercharged-Self-Healing-Revolutionary-High-Frequency-Consciousness/dp/073876809X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharged Self-Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Deprogram-Subconscious/dp/0738774251/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Change Your Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003Z2F/ctoc"},{"artist":"Vic Damone","title":"All The Things You Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MAVXGCA/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137KSWE/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"N'Sync","title":"Bye Bye Bye","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002TTPR30/ctoc"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Procol Harum","title":"A Whiter Shade Of Pale","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BZX2L8C8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BZX2L8C8"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"The Sunny Side Of The Street","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KURQGBU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00KURQGBU"},{"artist":"Emerson, Lake, & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It’s Worth","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0011Z76UA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0011Z76UA"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"Once Upon A Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D4N94QH6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0D4N94QH6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dffe019cc137bf2442013d5","%2F6196fc77fcb032b8eb633b34"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/numerology","keywords/energy","keywords/healing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b4a3569ebcaed11eff2560","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Aug 7 2024 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, numerologist \u003ca href=\"http://numberslady.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Glynis McCants\u003c/a> (877-686-2373) shared insights into what has transpired in these past few months on the political world stage, as well as what the numerology pattern showed for July and the new month of August. She delved into the numbers of the presidential candidates and their new running mates. JD Vance has a '5' lifepath and needs to learn to let go of positions that aren't working for him, like his 'childless cat lady' comment, McCants suggested. Out of six numbers that people can match up with, Donald Trump shares three numbers with Vance, but they also have three numbers that are in challenge with each other, which means it's going to take work for them to get along. She found that Vice President Harris and Gov. Tim Walz also have three challenge numbers out of six. The election on November 5th, 2024, is a '5' day, and interestingly, all four candidates have a '5' in their numbers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also presented details on how people can find their Destiny Number, which is determined by adding up the numbers associated with their full birth name (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1023925905767363&set=a.230584731768155\" target=\"_blank\">see this chart\u003c/a> for the breakdown). She revealed that George Noory has 9/1/1 for his birth certificate name, which represents &quot;Who do they call for help?&quot; and a &quot;1&quot; Destiny Number, which means he strives to be the best at what he does. McCants shared an analysis of several American Olympians who have won gold medals: Swimmer Katie Ledecky's numerology blueprint highlights her competitive nature and alignment of energies for success, while gymnast Simone Biles, who is in a personal year of '7,' demonstrates the lesson of being one's best self, despite not being a '1' lifepath. During the last hour, she gave readings for callers.

After a severe bout of sepsis and paralysis that doctors warned was going to kill him within 48 hours, Spina not only healed himself but also became determined to share his technique with others, a testament to the transformative power of self-healing. He highlighted the non-linear nature of healing and the importance of reaching a still, meditative state for self-repair. He introduced his new book &quot;Access Super Consciousness,&quot; which offers 24 transformative meditations designed to facilitate personal growth and deeper awareness. He views meditation as the space between thoughts that occurs in the present moment, as opposed to thinking, which is always a rumination or a projection that deals with the past or future.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Spina delved into the concept of self-mastery, describing it as having dominion over one's body, mind, and energy, similar to Buddhist and Hindu practices. His insights suggest that meditation is not just a practice, but a gateway to deeper understanding and fulfillment, offering a path to both personal and collective transformation. He articulated a vision of spirituality as practical, suggesting that &quot;spirituality isn't worth anything if it isn't applicable in our day-to-day life.&quot; Rather than belief, he emphasized the importance of &quot;knowingness&quot; and self-awareness. He shared his profound personal experiences with energy healing, describing a moment of clarity when he could actually feel electricity, &quot;and that's when I knew I was onto something.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.strategicfinancialintelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John Truman Wolfe\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Numbers-Reignite-Through-Numerology/dp/1402224494/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Love by the Numbers\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401301428/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Glynis Has Your Number\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Access-Super-Consciousness-Frequency-Obstacles/dp/0738777137/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Access Super Consciousness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Supercharged-Self-Healing-Revolutionary-High-Frequency-Consciousness/dp/073876809X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharged Self-Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Deprogram-Subconscious/dp/0738774251/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Change Your Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003Z2F/ctoc"},{"artist":"Vic Damone","title":"All The Things You Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MAVXGCA/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137KSWE/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"N'Sync","title":"Bye Bye Bye","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002TTPR30/ctoc"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Procol Harum","title":"A Whiter Shade Of Pale","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BZX2L8C8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BZX2L8C8"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"The Sunny Side Of The Street","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KURQGBU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00KURQGBU"},{"artist":"Emerson, Lake, & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It’s Worth","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0011Z76UA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0011Z76UA"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"Once Upon A Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D4N94QH6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0D4N94QH6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dffe019cc137bf2442013d5","%2F6196fc77fcb032b8eb633b34"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/numerology","keywords/energy","keywords/healing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b4a3569ebcaed11eff2560","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Aug 7 2024 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

One of the inspirations is the myth of Hyperborea, a legendary lost continent near the North Pole, rooted in ancient Greek mythology. Rollins suggested that the idea of Hyperborea continues to influence Russian ideology, particularly in the context of territorial claims and expansionism. He said many parts of the Arctic Circle are still unexplored, and there could be vast resources hidden beneath melting ice. His new novel also delves into the mysteries of lost libraries. It starts with the execution of a Vatican archivist within the shadow of the Kremlin, and this exposes a conspiracy going back three centuries-- to the bloody era of the Russian Tsars.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Shifting from fiction, he pointed out that various countries have been vying for control of the Arctic region. Russia has begun defending it specifically through military exercises involving thousands of troops and nuclear assets, he cited, adding that their fleet has &quot;over 40 icebreakers,&quot; in stark contrast to the US' two. The geopolitical stakes are compounded by China's investments in the region, aiming for easier access from the Pacific to the Atlantic, he continued. Rollins also detailed his access to the Vatican's archive and some of its hidden information. He divided their material into two categories-- ancient secrets, and modern secrets gleaned by the Vatican's vast intelligence agency that spans the globe.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Writer, researcher, and award-winning travel and documentary photographer \u003ca href=\"http://darraghmason.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Darragh Mason\u003c/a> hosts the podcast Spirit Box. In the latter half, he shared modern and folkloric accounts of the 'Dark Man' phenomenon as it relates to witchcraft and mysticism. The Dark Man could be thought of as &quot;a destructive force that reminds us that we are part of nature… it makes people understand that whatever you think about the world, all those things can be undermined in an instant,&quot; he stated. Mason shared that he became a believer in the phenomenon after an intense set of unlucky or unforeseen experiences while researching the jinn in Delhi that led up to a haunting, nightmarish encounter.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In Scottish folklore, the Dark Man appears as part animal, part human, and interrupts journeys, often in the form of a quest for a person's soul, he explained. In Irish folklore, he is considered a trickster figure, such as when a woman was cursed to live as a deer. According to Mason, the lore of the Dark Man can be found in the Scottish witch trials as a figure who appeared to people and lured them into magic. He also drew Dark Man parallels from the tales of the infamous Pied Piper of Hamelin, and Britain's \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring-heeled_Jack\" target=\"_blank\">Spring-Heeled Jack\u003c/a>, figures that invoke both terror and fascination.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the last half-hour, George featured an excerpt from his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2014-01-15-show/\" target=\"_blank\">1/15/14 interview\u003c/a> with William Henry on the 'Watchers.'\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

She referred to eighth-house individuals as &quot;phoenixes,&quot; highlighting their resilience and healing abilities stemming from early life losses. In contrast, those in the twelfth house resemble &quot;fallen angels,&quot; often feeling out of place and spiritually different from their families, expressing a sense of being &quot;from another world.&quot; Turner-Schott recounted her own spiritual awakening at age 16 when one night she witnessed a &quot;glowing ball of light&quot; that ignited her fascination with astrology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She highlighted the importance of lunar nodes in understanding one's direction in life. &quot;The north node is your soul's mission in this lifetime,&quot; Turner-Schott explained. &quot;It represents what you are here to learn.&quot; On the other hand, the south node reveals the important lessons we've already received. She also shared a reading she did for a young boy at the request of his family. The child was drawing strange images and telling his parents of a man standing at the foot of his bed. Turner-Schott soon discovered he was an eighth-house person. &quot;He had spiritual gifts that he was born with, but no one was understanding him, and he had a fascination with death and the soul and the afterlife,&quot; she recalled.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

She explained that her book, &quot;Para ab normal in Kentucky,&quot; was inspired by her family's encouragement to preserve her many stories of paranormal experiences spanning over 40 years. Satterfield detailed the process of remembering and piecing together her experiences, which date back to 1955 when she first encountered a ghost at the age of seven. This journey allowed her to reflect on her family's reactions and feelings during these occurrences, often bringing to light memories that seemed almost forgotten.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Satterfield clarified that neither she nor her family actively sought out such experiences. Rather, these events seemed to find them unexpectedly, often manifesting in benign and frightening ways. She recounted a specific early experience where she conversed with an elderly woman in a wheelchair who went unrecognized by anyone else in the household. This event, coupled with many others, solidified her belief in the reality of these abnormal encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Satterfield shared one of her most memorable and unsettling experiences from the 1970s when her family lived in a caretaker's house in Prospect, Kentucky. Shortly after moving in, she began hearing footsteps and experiencing other inexplicable phenomena. Her young son mentioned a ball returning to him by itself, and her daughter had terrifying encounters at night, including being hit by cold water out of nowhere. These experiences led to sleepless nights and a deep-seated fear that eventually compelled them to leave the house. Over the years, she learned that the area had a dark history of violence, which she believes contributed to the hauntings.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the latter 90 minutes of the program, \u003ca href=\"https://facebook.com/daryl.stangl.1\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Daryl Stangl\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed UFO-related experiences and his work in spirit releasement. Stangl detailed lifelong sightings and encounters with extraterrestrial beings, some of which he believes have negatively impacted his life. He emphasized the importance of his findings about negative extraterrestrial entities using abandoned coal mines in Iowa for underground bases, a topic he feels is deliberately kept hidden. Stangl touched on the hybridization programs conducted by extraterrestrial beings, drawing parallels between their efforts and human genetic research. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He reflected on his experiences over the past 25 years in dealing with paranormal activities and spirit releasement. According to Stangl, encountering such phenomena is often unexpected but inevitable when engaging deeply in this work. He shared a specific incident from 2003 when he moved into his current house and experienced paranormal knocking on the walls. After consulting a local group in Fairfield, Iowa, who specialized in spirit releasement, he discovered two spirits in his house—a little girl named Samantha McGinnis and a Civil War soldier named Samuel Cook. The group successfully cleared these spirits, stopping the knocking noises, which piqued Darryl's interest in spirit releasement.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Stangl delved into the phenomena of spirits not wanting to cross over due to unfinished business, as well as the impact of clearing negative spirits from various locations, including schools. He mentioned the unique challenges faced when dealing with spirits with significant emotional ties to their previous lives. Stangl also recounted a compelling encounter with the spirit of Chief Red Cloud, who tasked him with clearing Native American battle sites and the Trail of Tears, a mission he has actively pursued. \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Para-normal-Kentucky-collection-stories/dp/0692929401/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Para ab normal in Kentucky: A collection of true stories\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Paul McCartney","title":"Coming Up","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GNVZS8J/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GNVZS8J"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"It's Still Rock And Roll To Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137UWPM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137UWPM"},{"artist":"Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band","title":"Against The Wind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0721LF73L/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Spinners","title":"Cupid","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122RXIM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122RXIM"},{"artist":"Ambrosia","title":"Biggest Part Of Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001248CEY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001248CEY"},{"artist":"The Manhattans","title":"Shining Star","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01BD1IOMU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01BD1IOMU"},{"artist":"Pure Prairie League","title":"Let Me Love You Tonight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W0240M/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W0240M"},{"artist":"Bette Midler","title":"The Rose","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00GILXNA4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00GILXNA4"},{"artist":"Elton John","title":"Little Jeannie","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VWH0AA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VWH0AA"},{"artist":"Robbie Dupree","title":"Steal Away","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07R6GF5NS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07R6GF5NS"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"She's Out Of My Life","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137UTM8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137UTM8"},{"artist":"Olivia Newton-John","title":"Magic","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NRZYBY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NRZYBY"},{"artist":"Rocky Burnette","title":"Tired Of Toein' The Line","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BZXB6JNF/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BZXB6JNF"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"I'm Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NS3MT4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NS3MT4"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66ac1d48ea4696c6103c166c","%2F66ac1f8f789dd97540aedbd9"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/paranormal","keywords/spiritual"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66af662233d708ae6952f197","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 3 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66af663233d708ae6952f198","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 3 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66af664b33d708ae6952f19a","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 3 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66af665c33d708ae6952f19b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 3 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A conceptual image of the figure of a spirit floating into the light at the end of a tunnel.","id":"%2F60622134e9d3f3722e454142","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/60622134e9d3f3722e454142","source_credit":"sdominick / iStock / Getty Images","title":"The Spirit Carries On","url":"asset://assets.getty/60622134e9d3f3722e454142","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1722693600647},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-03-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Author \u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/diane-satterfield/s?k=diane+satterfield\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Diane Satterfield\u003c/u>\u003c/a> talked about her experiences with ghosts and the paranormal, and living in a haunted house.

He discussed the readings he's conducted of people who claim to have been abducted by aliens and the reasons why certain people are targeted for abduction and others are not. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Anthony recounted the story of Calvin Parker and Charles Hickson, who claimed to have been abducted by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula, Mississippi, in October 1973. According to Parker, they were paralyzed by a light from a metallic, football-shaped object, and then taken aboard by robotic entities. While on the ship, Parker described being injected with something and examined by what he perceived as a beautiful woman with reptilian-like fingers. Medical examinations later showed puncture wounds on their bodies which corroborated their story, Anthony reported. He emphasized that Parker and Hickson consistently passed lie detector tests and other interrogations, reinforcing their credibility.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Anthony discussed a gallery event in Denver where he connected with a young man who had repeatedly been abducted by aliens. During a reading, Anthony received a message from the man's deceased grandfather indicating that the aliens were interested in how he metabolized protein. This detail matched findings from other abductees who experienced a craving for protein and salt post-abduction, he explained. Anthony linked this to research suggesting that aliens might use extracted human protein as nourishment or for other purposes, such as cloning. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also shared insights related to the Roswell incident that were provided to him by his father who held a top-secret clearance in the late 1950s. Anthony said his father revealed the rapid transition in the U.S. from transistor-based technology to silicon chips was the result of extraterrestrial technology recovered from Roswell. He expressed his belief in a government cover-up of Roswell and the extraterrestrial influences on our technological progress.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Joe from Pennsylvania shared his experiences at Gettysburg, which included a stay at the haunted Farnsworth Inn. While on a ghost tour, Joe recalled feeling a sudden wave of dizziness in the basement, which was once used as a makeshift morgue. At the same time, the ghost-hunting equipment being used by the group went off and pointed towards him, Joe revealed. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jeff in Lincoln, Nebraska, recounted a 2009 case where James Walbert claimed his business associate used electromagnetic radiation to attack him. Jeff connected this to his belief that a major cell phone company is involved in targeting individuals with directed energy weapons. He revealed his own experiences of numerous attempted murders and attacks that left him with severe injuries. Jeff further claimed that cell towers are used to direct these attacks and mentioned an incident where a scalar microwave beam caused a significant leg injury.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>George from Portland, Oregon, argued that life moves from complex to simple, contrary to the scientific view that it moves from simple to complex. He asserted that a complex God is necessary to create complex humans who can in turn reproduce. He believes this points to a divine creator, as for him evolution does not sufficiently explain human creation. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://heidihollis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Heidi Hollis\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> / \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Evidence-Eternity-Communicating-Spirits-Afterlife/dp/0738743887/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Evidence of Eternity\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Never-Letting-Go-Grief-Other/dp/0738727210/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Never Letting Go: Heal Grief with Help from the Other Side\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"Paul Anka","title":"Put Your Head On My Shoulder","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138EYMS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Black Magic Woman","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GKW6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GKW6"},{"artist":"Fleetwood Mac","title":"Hypnotized","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRRZGK9/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0YLVE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0YLVE"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Changes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D36EYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D36EYY"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"The Magnificent Seven","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EQRLWS2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EQRLWS2"},{"artist":"Nancy Sinatra","title":"Some Velvet Morning","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000QO3IDQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000QO3IDQ"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Morphing Thru Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LZRZ1J/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LZRZ1J"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1S7YI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W1S7YI"},{"artist":"Allman Brothers","title":"Jessica","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GJ1R79G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GJ1R79G"},{"artist":"ABBA","title":"Dancing Queen","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LNHR1F/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LNHR1F"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Beyond The Invisible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IULF9TC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"World Party","title":"When You Come Back To Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001BKGMXC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001BKGMXC"},{"artist":"UFO Phil","title":"Listening to Coast to Coast","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0777PT81Y/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e006c25537fd678a3eceb1f","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/spirit communications","keywords/alien abduction"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ae0c1781e06da650d5c71f","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 2 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ae0c2781e06da650d5c720","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 2 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ae0c3481e06da650d5c721","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 2 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ae0c4181e06da650d5c722","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 2 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A ghostly transparent woman.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Armstrong created the software in the 1970s to track global capital movements, and it accurately forecasted major financial events such as the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash. He soon discovered his code's potential to predict a wide range of global events. &quot;If there's going to be a war, somebody knows in advance, and they start moving their money,&quot; he stated. Armstrong recalled the moment when his program predicted the onset of civil war in Lebanon. &quot;It said the country would fall apart in eight days… [and] eight days later, the civil war began,&quot; he noted. He also insisted that Socrates had anticipated the COVID-19 outbreak. &quot;It was more or less orchestrated,&quot; he said, before revealing that powerful executives knew the virus was coming.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation touched on the political landscape, with Armstrong sharing that Socrates predicted a Republican victory in the 2024 elections. &quot;It doesn't matter who the candidate is,&quot; he remarked. While on the topic of current events, he addressed escalating global tensions, particularly the potential for World War III. He noted that various governments in Europe are preparing for conflict, warning that &quot;everybody over there... just wants war.&quot; Armstrong expressed concern about the rhetoric surrounding nuclear threats, criticizing the belief that &quot;Russia will never push the button.&quot; Predicting significant changes by 2032, he claimed, &quot;You're looking at the end of republics,&quot; and expressed his hope for a shift towards real democracy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, professional counselor and medical and emotional intuitive \u003ca href=\"https://katiebeecher.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Katie Beecher\u003c/a> described her extraordinary journey into the world of intuitive healing. She shared with listeners her lifelong connection to spiritual guides. &quot;I remember... hearing voices in my head, feeling safe and protected, knowing there was something greater than me,&quot; she recalled of her early years. Beecher recounted how her childhood fears of negative energies evolved into a desire to help others. &quot;I decided that I wanted to live my life differently,&quot; she stated. She further elaborated on her work as a medical intuitive, explaining, &quot;I help people figure out what makes them unhappy and what their skills are.&quot; According to her, intuition involves recognizing bodily symptoms as messages rather than threats. She encourages clients to engage with their discomfort, saying, &quot;We can listen and use it for our health.&quot; At the same time, Beecher insists on setting boundaries with certain people who have negative energies, relating her own chilling encounter with a politician's dark aura. &quot;He repelled me from the other side of the room — it was that strong,&quot; she recalled.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Beecher explained that many clients come to her with vague or unrecognized diagnoses. &quot;It's probably about a third of the people I work with who have an idea, but don't really know the root causes,&quot; she noted. She spoke about the transformative case of a young woman suffering from severe Lyme disease and mold poisoning who had given up on life. After intuitively identifying her health issues, Beecher guided her to a specialized Lyme doctor, leading to the woman's remarkable recovery. &quot;She is thriving, and she just told me she ran a 5k last weekend,&quot; she related. Discussing her techniques, Beecher highlighted a method of writing a dialogue with one's intuition, a practice that aided her own healing journey. She emphasized the importance of intuition over reliance on tools like tarot cards, stating, &quot;You may not listen, and then you also may rely more on tools than on consulting with your intuition.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://nelkenfoodsafetycoach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Jeff Nelken\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cu>\u003cem>,\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://myheartbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Manipulating-World-Economy-Inevitable-Alternative/dp/1662914466/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Manipulating the World Economy\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/China-Rise-Become-Financial-Capital/dp/B07FN7PDVN/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">China on the Rise\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Heal-Within-Guidebook-Intuitive-Wellness/dp/1250780241/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Heal from Within: A Guidebook to Intuitive Wellness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMZHBC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMZHBC"},{"artist":"Mel Carter","title":"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SZGWDG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SZGWDG"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001380KQC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001380KQC"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Don't Fear The Reaper","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138EX1K/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GN1U3A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GN1U3A"},{"artist":"Barry Manilow","title":"Summer Wind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001380LS4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001380LS4"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NTZFO8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NTZFO8"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Light My Fire","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AYH4G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AYH4G"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Turn Around","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD98W4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD98W4"},{"artist":"Bobby Darin","title":"Mack the Knife","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122A2OE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122A2OE"},{"artist":"Emerson, Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare for the Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"U2","title":"Beautiful Day","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O59AKG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O59AKG"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Silence Must Be Heard","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDEZUO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDEZUO"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"That's Life","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TU1BWTS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00TU1BWTS"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66a2e8117fbe00f971a2a7b5","%2F63d9b8141a52c8708e51badc"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/finances","keywords/global forecasting","keywords/intuition","keywords/healing","keywords/entities"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66acbb91b8276ee4cd362be6","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Aug 1 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66acbba0b8276ee4cd362be7","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Aug 1 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66acbbadb8276ee4cd362be8","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Aug 1 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66acbbbbb8276ee4cd362be9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Aug 1 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Global network and financial technology concept.","id":"%2F66a301962548400aed1d0732","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66a301962548400aed1d0732","source_credit":"metamorworks / iStock / Getty Images","title":"Global network and financial technology concept.","url":"asset://assets.getty/66a301962548400aed1d0732","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1722520800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-01-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Economic forecaster \u003ca href=\"https://armstrongeconomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Armstrong\u003c/a> shared insights from his groundbreaking predictive computer program Socrates.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Backman told listeners of the trauma that caused her to explore this higher spiritual plane. &quot;The premature birth and passing of my second baby... sent me into a classic grief process,&quot; she shared. It was the death of a close colleague from lung cancer that ultimately led her to regression therapy, where she learned to uncover patients' buried emotions, memories, and even past lives. She described souls as &quot;fragments of consciousness&quot; that come to Earth to grow and evolve, claiming, &quot;Earth was designed as an experiment... to see if we as humans could make primarily more healthy choices.&quot; Backman believes in the existence of souls beyond Earth, suggesting that &quot;there are different types of souls... intended to evolve in different places.&quot; \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also reflected on the legacy of Michael Newton, a pioneer in hypnosis and past-life regression therapy. Backman praised Newton as &quot;a fascinating person with a very inquisitive mind.&quot; She elaborated on the concept of the angelic realm, describing it as a &quot;group of highly advanced souls&quot; that provides guidance from a higher frequency. When asked about the motivations of those seeking regression therapy, she explained that patients are often looking for answers about their purpose in life. &quot;What I think happens... is that clients are being prompted by their own spiritual guides,&quot; she proposed. Backman also recounted the striking case of one patient, a medical doctor, who discovered she was an &quot;interplanetary soul&quot; after exploring her repressed childlike tendencies. She summarized the regression experience by saying, &quot;It gives you a bigger picture of who you are and why you're here.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, renowned psychic \u003ca href=\"http://johnrussell.net/\" target=\"_blank\">John Russell\u003c/a> spoke about how to strengthen your psychic abilities, the government's encounters with ETs, and animal connections. He discussed his new book, 20 Ways to Increase Your Psychic Abilities, which contains techniques to help readers enhance their spiritual connection and improve their lives. &quot;A lot of people focus on just one technique,&quot; Russell noted, like dream interpretation or psychometry. The conversation shifted to societal concerns, where Russell expressed alarm over growing divisiveness, stating, &quot;We've gotten to a place where we're hostile towards one another.&quot; He urged for compassion and understanding, emphasizing that &quot;none of us has a handle on the truth&quot; while advocating for an openness to different viewpoints. Russell also touched on his own psychic experiences with UFO phenomena, revealing a vision of a military employee in contact with extraterrestrials, asserting, &quot;This has been going on for a long, long time.&quot; He called for greater government transparency about these interactions, stating, &quot;We have to keep pushing for that disclosure.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Russell outlined the connection between the psychic world and animals. He recounted a pivotal moment from his childhood when a squirrel alerted him to a nearby cat threatening its life. &quot;The squirrel was like, 'Hey, I'm in danger here. I need some help,'&quot; Russell explained, highlighting how animals communicate their needs if we take the time to listen. He also shared a remarkable encounter with a snake, which he initially found intimidating. After touching the snake, he realized it was capable of forming a deep bond with him, even protecting him from potential harm. Russell emphasized the importance of paying attention to our pets. &quot;If you really pay attention, you're going to begin to develop that psychic bond,&quot; he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Michael Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://ravenheartcenter.com/index.php/bringing-your-soul-to-light-by-dr-linda-backman\" target=\"_blank\">Bringing Your Soul to Light: Healing Through Past Lives and the Time Between\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://ravenheartcenter.com/index.php/souls-on-earth-by-dr-linda-backman\" target=\"_blank\">Souls on Earth: Exploring Interplanetary Past Lives\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://ravenheartcenter.com/index.php/the-evolving-soul-by-dr-linda-backman\" target=\"_blank\">The Evolving Soul: Spiritual Healing Through Past Life Exploration\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Ways-Increase-Your-Psychic-Abilities/dp/1977255272/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">20 Ways to Increase Your Psychic Abilities\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Riding-Ghosts-Angels-Spirits-Dead/dp/1977233287/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Riding with Ghosts, Angels, and the Spirits of the Dead\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GN1C9C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GN1C9C"},{"artist":"Doris Day","title":"Secret Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00IX8ZMEA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00IX8ZMEA"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Little by Little","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122JZL0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122JZL0"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Once in a Lifetime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073XFQSS8/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Lucky Jack","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K60GZNE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Charlatans UK","title":"I Don't Want To See The Sights","url":"https://amazon.com/Charlatans-dont-Want-Sights-1992/dp/B0027A5ECA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Blondie","title":"Call Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SZ2320/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SZ2320"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Principles Of Lust","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001LKL8QI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001LKL8QI"},{"artist":"Bette Midler","title":"The Rose","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00GILXNA4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00GILXNA4"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Lovin' Spoonful\t","title":"Summer In The City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B006P2QR3G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B006P2QR3G"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Gravity Of Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCW7C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCW7C"},{"artist":"New Order","title":"Regret","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003A8YPE6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003A8YPE6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00bc96cc137bf244201d0d","%2F5f6d45c5d1a208e99d5c6e1f"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/past lives","keywords/reincarnation","keywords/psychic abilities","keywords/ghosts"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ab672c05c4a4da9f968eb6","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jul 31 2024 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, explorer, adventurer, author, journalist, and documentary filmmaker <a href="http://dangerousmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Robert Young Pelton</a> discussed the tensions in the Middle East and the complexities of the situation. &quot;It's like a big bucket of gasoline and people throwing matches at each other,&quot; he noted, capturing the volatility of the current conflict. In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.</p>

<p>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.</p>

<p>---------------------------</p>

<p>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. <a href="https://alishadas.com/" target="_blank">Alisha Das</a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.</p>

<p>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;</p>

the first half, explorer, adventurer, author, journalist, and documentary filmmaker \u003ca href=\"http://dangerousmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Young Pelton\u003c/a> discussed the tensions in the Middle East and the complexities of the situation. &quot;It's like a big bucket of gasoline and people throwing matches at each other,&quot; he noted, capturing the volatility of the current conflict. In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

As a dispatcher, he frequently received UFO-related calls, and eventually built up a huge database of &quot;high strangeness&quot; cases where entity reports sometimes intertwined with UFO sightings. In one incident from December 1989, a security guard called 911 from a payphone at around 3 am from a shopping center in South Dade. He described seeing three very thin, seven-foot-tall beings with huge cat-like eyes. Back then, many officers hesitated to report such events due to the stigma around such unusual phenomena, but he believes people are more open-minded now.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His database of entity encounters spans the globe, with cases from such countries as Brazil, France, Italy, and Ukraine. In Vietnam, soldiers have reported encountering Reptilians in caves, and such creatures have been seen in caves in other countries as well, he said. Rosales pondered the mysterious nature of these cases, suggesting that the beings may use interdimensional portals or wormholes to travel to Earth, and they may have been coming here for millennia or, in the case of the Reptilians, already live here underground. Rosales also detailed encounters with what he calls &quot;para-humans&quot;-- entities that sometimes can pass for human, and may use clothing to cover their non-human features.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed encounters with humanoids in the Cape Canaveral area, and mysterious activity in Florida waters, which has led him to suspect there may be underwater bases in the region. Rosales recounted a chilling childhood encounter in Cuba, where he witnessed an &quot;egg-shaped&quot; object during a blackout. &quot;I followed it... I stood under the thing... Next thing I remember was my mom calling my name,&quot; he recalled, hinting at possible missing time. He also addressed strange noises and low-flying helicopters plaguing his neighborhood, which prompted his curiosity about their purpose.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Quantum Science &amp; Telepathy\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>In the first hour, nanotechnology expert \u003ca href=\"https://historianofthefuturex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Charles Ostman\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed the intersection of quantum technology, artificial intelligence, and potential telepathic communication. The conversation delved into groundbreaking studies suggesting a connection between quantum mechanics and neural functions. The scale and complexity of the quantum computing approach is so vastly different than any traditional computer that it's almost like a completely different universe, and advancements in quantum entanglement might lead to enhanced telepathic abilities, he commented. &quot;We may be at the edge of understanding telepathy,&quot; he added, emphasizing the existence of latent abilities in humans, as well as the implications of using AI to replicate telepathic communication.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

The Institute is devoted to the study of subtle-energy sciences including remote viewing, crop circles and related subjects. Dr. Hein has a Ph.D. in sociology and has previously taught research methodology at Washington State University. Dr. Hein first learned remote viewing in 1996 and subsequently became involved in crop circle research.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, explorer, adventurer, author, journalist, and documentary filmmaker \u003ca href=\"http://dangerousmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Young Pelton\u003c/a> discussed the tensions in the Middle East and the complexities of the situation. &quot;It's like a big bucket of gasoline and people throwing matches at each other,&quot; he noted, capturing the volatility of the current conflict. In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, explorer, adventurer, author, journalist, and documentary filmmaker \u003ca href=\"http://dangerousmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Young Pelton\u003c/a> discussed the tensions in the Middle East and the complexities of the situation. &quot;It's like a big bucket of gasoline and people throwing matches at each other,&quot; he noted, capturing the volatility of the current conflict. In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

As a dispatcher, he frequently received UFO-related calls, and eventually built up a huge database of &quot;high strangeness&quot; cases where entity reports sometimes intertwined with UFO sightings. In one incident from December 1989, a security guard called 911 from a payphone at around 3 am from a shopping center in South Dade. He described seeing three very thin, seven-foot-tall beings with huge cat-like eyes. Back then, many officers hesitated to report such events due to the stigma around such unusual phenomena, but he believes people are more open-minded now.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His database of entity encounters spans the globe, with cases from such countries as Brazil, France, Italy, and Ukraine. In Vietnam, soldiers have reported encountering Reptilians in caves, and such creatures have been seen in caves in other countries as well, he said. Rosales pondered the mysterious nature of these cases, suggesting that the beings may use interdimensional portals or wormholes to travel to Earth, and they may have been coming here for millennia or, in the case of the Reptilians, already live here underground. Rosales also detailed encounters with what he calls &quot;para-humans&quot;-- entities that sometimes can pass for human, and may use clothing to cover their non-human features.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed encounters with humanoids in the Cape Canaveral area, and mysterious activity in Florida waters, which has led him to suspect there may be underwater bases in the region. Rosales recounted a chilling childhood encounter in Cuba, where he witnessed an &quot;egg-shaped&quot; object during a blackout. &quot;I followed it... I stood under the thing... Next thing I remember was my mom calling my name,&quot; he recalled, hinting at possible missing time. He also addressed strange noises and low-flying helicopters plaguing his neighborhood, which prompted his curiosity about their purpose.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Quantum Science &amp; Telepathy\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>In the first hour, nanotechnology expert \u003ca href=\"https://historianofthefuturex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Charles Ostman\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed the intersection of quantum technology, artificial intelligence, and potential telepathic communication. The conversation delved into groundbreaking studies suggesting a connection between quantum mechanics and neural functions. The scale and complexity of the quantum computing approach is so vastly different than any traditional computer that it's almost like a completely different universe, and advancements in quantum entanglement might lead to enhanced telepathic abilities, he commented. &quot;We may be at the edge of understanding telepathy,&quot; he added, emphasizing the existence of latent abilities in humans, as well as the implications of using AI to replicate telepathic communication.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Albert Rosales\u003c/u>\u003c/a> made his debut on Coast to Coast, delving into his extensive research into UFOs and humanoid encounters. As a dispatcher, he frequently received UFO-related calls, and eventually built up a huge database of &quot;high strangeness&quot; cases where entity reports sometimes intertwined with UFO sightings. In one incident from December 1989, a security guard called 911 from a payphone at around 3 am from a shopping center in South Dade. He described seeing three very thin, seven-foot-tall beings with huge cat-like eyes. Back then, many officers hesitated to report such events due to the stigma around such unusual phenomena, but he believes people are more open-minded now.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His database of entity encounters spans the globe, with cases from such countries as Brazil, France, Italy, and Ukraine. In Vietnam, soldiers have reported encountering Reptilians in caves, and such creatures have been seen in caves in other countries as well, he said. Rosales pondered the mysterious nature of these cases, suggesting that the beings may use interdimensional portals or wormholes to travel to Earth, and they may have been coming here for millennia or, in the case of the Reptilians, already live here underground. Rosales also detailed encounters with what he calls &quot;para-humans&quot;-- entities that sometimes can pass for human, and may use clothing to cover their non-human features.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He detailed encounters with humanoids in the Cape Canaveral area, and mysterious activity in Florida waters, which has led him to suspect there may be underwater bases in the region. Rosales recounted a chilling childhood encounter in Cuba, where he witnessed an &quot;egg-shaped&quot; object during a blackout. &quot;I followed it... I stood under the thing... Next thing I remember was my mom calling my name,&quot; he recalled, hinting at possible missing time. He also addressed strange noises and low-flying helicopters plaguing his neighborhood, which prompted his curiosity about their purpose.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch2>Quantum Science &amp; Telepathy\u003c/h2>\n\n\u003cp>In the first hour, nanotechnology expert \u003ca href=\"https://historianofthefuturex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Charles Ostman\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed the intersection of quantum technology, artificial intelligence, and potential telepathic communication. The conversation delved into groundbreaking studies suggesting a connection between quantum mechanics and neural functions. The scale and complexity of the quantum computing approach is so vastly different than any traditional computer that it's almost like a completely different universe, and advancements in quantum entanglement might lead to enhanced telepathic abilities, he commented. &quot;We may be at the edge of understanding telepathy,&quot; he added, emphasizing the existence of latent abilities in humans, as well as the implications of using AI to replicate telepathic communication.

Feinstein was initially skeptical of the technique, but embraced tapping after witnessing its dramatic effects during a demonstration. He described watching a participant with severe claustrophobia experience a significant reduction in anxiety after just a few rounds of tapping, stating, &quot;I had never seen anything work that fast with a long-standing, lifelong phobia.&quot; The session culminated in the participant eagerly entering a coat closet, something her claustrophobia would have never let her do before. Feinstein compared tapping to acupuncture in its ability to balance the body's energy through pointed awareness. &quot;When you think about a problem... that becomes like a magnet that crafts the [healing] signal to that part of the brain,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Feinstein, it's important to know when to seek professional assistance for this tapping technique, especially for more severe issues like chronic depression. He warned that it can unearth deeper, overwhelming emotions without proper guidance. &quot;There's a great deal that can be done on a self-help basis, but there is a point where it really is advisable to be working with somebody that is skilled,&quot; he stated. He referenced a study demonstrating the efficacy of tapping for food cravings, revealing that after sessions, participants showed less brain activity related to hunger. While he acknowledged the complexity of addiction treatment, Feinstein asserted that tapping can be a significant component. &quot;Addictions require a multi-modal approach,&quot; he admitted, &quot;but tapping can really help.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author and former deputy sheriff \u003ca href=\"https://ronfelber.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron Felber\u003c/a> delved into the eerie world of extraterrestrial encounters from his captivating book, Mojave Incident. The work, inspired by the true story of Elise and Tom Gifford, recounts a mysterious night in the Mojave Desert that forever altered the couple's lives. The story is set against the backdrop of October 21, 1989, when the Giffords, a stable couple with young children, sought a brief escape from their demanding lives. As they set up camp beneath the stars, they were initially charmed by the serenity of their surroundings. However, the night took a dramatic turn when they witnessed a growing number of objects in the sky. &quot;At first, they thought, 'Well, Nellis Air Force Base isn't too far away,'&quot; Felber relayed, &quot;but they knew it was strange. [The lights] started dropping... and they see glowing red eyes... charging towards them. This is heart-stopping.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Tom, a hunter, retrieved a shotgun, ready to confront whatever they were facing. Yet in a twist of events, Elise began receiving telepathic messages urging them to put the weapon down and comply. The couple's terror deepened as hundreds of gremlin-like creatures and nine illuminated figures surrounded the camper, initiating a series of torturous visions that forced the Giffords to relive traumatic experiences from their pasts. However, amid the chaos, an angelic presence emerged, providing hope. While Felber initially approached the couple's tale with skepticism, he found it impossible to dismiss their experiences as mere fantasy. &quot;I knew they weren't lying,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Tapping-Self-Healing-Transformative-Energy-Psychology/dp/1683649966/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Tapping: Self-Healing with the Transformative Power of Energy Psychology\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1569802130/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mojave Incident\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unwelcomed-Curious-Case-Clara-Fowler/dp/168513419X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Unwelcomed: The Curious Case of Clara Fowler\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"The Who","title":"All This Music Must Fade","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07XGMBV78/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07XGMBV78"},{"artist":"Tom Waits","title":"Cold Cold Ground","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CB5FHCBY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CB5FHCBY"},{"artist":"Stevie Nicks","title":"Think About It","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01M67AKW0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01M67AKW0"},{"artist":"Oliver Anthony","title":"I Want to Go Home","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CZ18FSSW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CZ18FSSW"},{"artist":"Sugar Billy","title":"Super Duper Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09MS8MCW8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B09MS8MCW8"},{"artist":"Paul Pena","title":"Jet Airliner","url":"https://amazon.com/Jet-Airliner-Paul-Pena-ebook/dp/B00DK3Z21Q/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Monkees","title":"Love to Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00124D5R8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00124D5R8"},{"artist":"Kid Rock & Sheryl Crow","title":"Collide","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004BC7NBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004BC7NBW"},{"artist":"Lynyrd Skynyrd","title":"Gimme Back My Bullets","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V698OC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Eric Clapton & Van Morrison","title":"The Rebels","url":"https://amazon.com/Rebels-Slowhand-Van/dp/B095M4FGCT/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Joe Cocker","title":"Bye Bye Blackbird","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NYBS6C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NYBS6C"},{"artist":"The Rolling Stones","title":"You Got The Silver","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07XG2F41C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07XG2F41C"},{"artist":"John Mayer","title":"Gravity","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001BKU2LU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001BKU2LU"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night (Barking At Airplanes)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TE568I/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TE568I"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66b54717f5ae1fc661925692","%2F5e018006537fd678a3ecf745"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/tapping","keywords/alien encounter"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b89be377ee72df05a5e54f","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 10 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b89bf277ee72df05a5e550","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 10 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b89c0077ee72df05a5e551","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 10 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b89c1a77ee72df05a5e552","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 10 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Flying saucer hovering above a car at night.","id":"%2F66b55b26f7990c49e6d6118b","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66b55b26f7990c49e6d6118b","source_credit":"Joe Regan / Moment / Getty Images","title":"UFO and Car","url":"asset://assets.getty/66b55b26f7990c49e6d6118b","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1723298400000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-10-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://edenmethod.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Feinstein\u003c/a> discussed the efficacy of tapping specific body points to alleviate stress and anxiety.

Knudsen, founder of 4RBees, discussed the urgent problem of bee colony collapse disorder and how his PureWave Cell aims to combat it. He claimed this device's neodymium magnets, arranged in sacred geometry, influence cellular health across various organisms, including bees. &quot;If I can go in to the hives and build up the immune systems of the bees, they could ward off toxins and diseases,&quot; Knudsen explained. Havas, an environmental toxicologist, noted promising early results. &quot;The hives with the PureWave Cells seem to be doing so much better,&quot; she shared, noting that those bees had better hygiene and produced higher quality honey.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Knudsen described the technology as akin to &quot;sound canceling headphones,&quot; with frequencies aimed at neutralizing pathogens. He told listeners, &quot;We removed in some cases 60-80% of the pathogens&quot; during food testing. They also shared insights on using PureWave Cells for various ailments and household applications, indicating potential benefits for pets and humans alike. Knudsen noted the project's positive ripple effect on other pollinators, like monarch butterflies, by protecting their habitats. When discussing the skepticism faced in the scientific community about using magnets and frequency for healing, Havas said, &quot;It depends what country you're in... but magnetic therapy has been around for thousands of years.&quot; She believes it's this very therapy that can save not only bees, but ourselves. &quot;Our very survival depends on bees,&quot; she emphasized.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half of the program featured Open Lines, where listeners call in to talk about topics of interest. Robert from New York praised the previous discussion about bees while criticizing the dark history of pesticides like DDT. He stressed the importance of protecting the Earth for future generations. Jeff from Lincoln, Nebraska expressed alarm over advanced technology for remote neural monitoring and brain frequency manipulation, suggesting it could be misused by individuals attempting to extort money. Frank from North Carolina discussed the topic of Australian hospitals using bee venom to cure serious illness.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Blue Diamond, a truck driver passing through Indiana, discussed her experience during COVID, emphasizing how frequency therapy helped her scan and treat herself for illnesses while on the road. JR from South Carolina expressed skepticism regarding claims about alternative health technologies, arguing that if such solutions were effective, the world's widespread health issues would be addressed already. Alexander from Virginia shared a personal success story with scalar energy treatments, indicating that after just one session, he no longer needed medication for a virus in his eye.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Joe from Ohio expressed concern over the potential pushback against research on bee venom's disease-fighting properties. He mentioned working with Dr. Alphonzo Monzo on frequency-based treatments to combat the effects of electromagnetic radiation. Howard from Vancouver, Washington recounted a story about his grandfather's acquaintance who, after being stung by bees, experienced relief from severe arthritis.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc"},{"artist":"Deep Purple","title":"If I Were You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D1LMLCXN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0D1LMLCXN"},{"artist":"The Teskey Brothers","title":"Rain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0B9ZFN1P6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0B9ZFN1P6"},{"artist":"Betty Wright","title":"Shoorah!

His studies have led him to a fascinating conclusion-- not one, but two separate UFO crashes occurred near Roswell in 1947. &quot;They found two debris fields of wreckage, as if... something had disintegrated in mid-air,&quot; he detailed. The site in Socorro, New Mexico, revealed a &quot;pretty much intact disc, but it had a big hole in the side, and there were dead aliens inside and on the ground; some of them may have been alive.&quot; He noted government &quot;compartmentalization&quot; limited knowledge among military personnel at the Roswell base about these incidents.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Regarding the cause of these crashes, Brandenburg dismissed radar interference and lightning as potential culprits. He believes it was likely a military clash, as the UFOs were suspected of spying on US nuclear facilities, and there was heightened security, given that it was only two years after World War II, and there were also ingrained cultural narratives about hostile aliens such as from &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot; WWII vets in a propeller-driven twin-engine plane with four 20-millimeter cannons and machine guns on a turret on the top shot down one of the craft and blew up the other one, he posited. Brandenburg conjectured that the two downed craft may have been scout ships sent out by an interstellar mothership.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Prof. \u003ca href=\"https://www.reading.ac.uk/history/our-staff/dr-richard-blakemore\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Blakemore\u003c/a> has been writing and teaching about historical piracy and maritime empire for over a decade. In the latter half, he discussed the so-called 'Golden Age' of piracy, which steered major events in the 17th and 18th centuries. The &quot;romanticized image&quot; of pirates depicted in books and movies comes from this era. Piracy often stemmed from the economic motivations of sailors transitioning from wartime activities to illegal plundering once conflicts ended, he explained. They sought out valuable cargo, including silver from the Spanish Empire, and luxury goods like silk and spices, he continued, adding that they operated mainly in concentrated trade routes, particularly in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Pirates used intimidation and deceitful tactics like flying false flags, and there was an interconnectedness between piracy and colonial economies, as &quot;some colonies would not have survived without the income coming in from plunder,&quot; Blakemore revealed. Pirates had their own code of conduct, and some were more than just outlaws like \u003ca href=\"https://ocean.si.edu/human-connections/exploration/william-dampier-pirate-who-collected-plants\" target=\"_blank\">William Dampier\u003c/a>, a renowned voyager and author, who chronicled his observations from far-flung places. Blakemore spoke about the lives of two notorious female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read, suggesting that historical accounts of them often reflected societal fears and stereotypes about women. He also touched on modern piracy, such as off the coast of Somalia, where various vessels have been attacked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DC5ZFJZ9/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Cosmic Awakening\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Life-Death-Mars-New-Synthesis/dp/1935487361/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Life and Death on Mars: The New Mars Synthesis\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Einsteins-Unified-Field-Electro-Magnetism/dp/1935487426/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Einstein's Unified Field: Gravity &amp; Electro-Magnetism Redefined\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Enemies-All-Rise-Golden-Piracy/dp/1639366334/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Enemies of All: The Rise and Fall of the Golden Age of Piracy\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GN1C9C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GN1C9C"},{"artist":"Rod Stewart","title":"The Way You Look Tonight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136PXWU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136PXWU"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122KGOU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122KGOU"},{"artist":"Fleetwood Mac","title":"Hypnotized","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRRZGK9/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K60GZNE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Summer Wind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TU1BU0Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00TU1BU0Y"},{"artist":"Frank Zappa","title":"Peaches En Regalia","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00B2Z1G1Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00B2Z1G1Y"},{"artist":"U2","title":"Where The Streets Have No Name","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NB1TX2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NB1TX2"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCZ0G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCZ0G"},{"artist":"Johnny Mathis","title":"Wonderful!

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

She delved into the numbers of the presidential candidates and their new running mates. JD Vance has a '5' lifepath and needs to learn to let go of positions that aren't working for him, like his 'childless cat lady' comment, McCants suggested. Out of six numbers that people can match up with, Donald Trump shares three numbers with Vance, but they also have three numbers that are in challenge with each other, which means it's going to take work for them to get along. She found that Vice President Harris and Gov. Tim Walz also have three challenge numbers out of six. The election on November 5th, 2024, is a '5' day, and interestingly, all four candidates have a '5' in their numbers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also presented details on how people can find their Destiny Number, which is determined by adding up the numbers associated with their full birth name (\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1023925905767363&set=a.230584731768155\" target=\"_blank\">see this chart\u003c/a> for the breakdown). She revealed that George Noory has 9/1/1 for his birth certificate name, which represents &quot;Who do they call for help?&quot; and a &quot;1&quot; Destiny Number, which means he strives to be the best at what he does. McCants shared an analysis of several American Olympians who have won gold medals: Swimmer Katie Ledecky's numerology blueprint highlights her competitive nature and alignment of energies for success, while gymnast Simone Biles, who is in a personal year of '7,' demonstrates the lesson of being one's best self, despite not being a '1' lifepath.

After a severe bout of sepsis and paralysis that doctors warned was going to kill him within 48 hours, Spina not only healed himself but also became determined to share his technique with others, a testament to the transformative power of self-healing. He highlighted the non-linear nature of healing and the importance of reaching a still, meditative state for self-repair. He introduced his new book &quot;Access Super Consciousness,&quot; which offers 24 transformative meditations designed to facilitate personal growth and deeper awareness. He views meditation as the space between thoughts that occurs in the present moment, as opposed to thinking, which is always a rumination or a projection that deals with the past or future.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Spina delved into the concept of self-mastery, describing it as having dominion over one's body, mind, and energy, similar to Buddhist and Hindu practices. His insights suggest that meditation is not just a practice, but a gateway to deeper understanding and fulfillment, offering a path to both personal and collective transformation. He articulated a vision of spirituality as practical, suggesting that &quot;spirituality isn't worth anything if it isn't applicable in our day-to-day life.&quot; Rather than belief, he emphasized the importance of &quot;knowingness&quot; and self-awareness. He shared his profound personal experiences with energy healing, describing a moment of clarity when he could actually feel electricity, &quot;and that's when I knew I was onto something.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.strategicfinancialintelligence.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John Truman Wolfe\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Numbers-Reignite-Through-Numerology/dp/1402224494/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Love by the Numbers\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1401301428/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Glynis Has Your Number\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Access-Super-Consciousness-Frequency-Obstacles/dp/0738777137/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Access Super Consciousness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Supercharged-Self-Healing-Revolutionary-High-Frequency-Consciousness/dp/073876809X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Supercharged Self-Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Change-Your-Mind-Deprogram-Subconscious/dp/0738774251/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Change Your Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Express-Original-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000001FBZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003Z2F/ctoc"},{"artist":"Vic Damone","title":"All The Things You Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MAVXGCA/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137KSWE/ctoc/?"},{"artist":"N'Sync","title":"Bye Bye Bye","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002TTPR30/ctoc"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Suffragette City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2O15Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D2O15Y"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Procol Harum","title":"A Whiter Shade Of Pale","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BZX2L8C8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BZX2L8C8"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"The Sunny Side Of The Street","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KURQGBU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00KURQGBU"},{"artist":"Emerson, Lake, & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Buffalo Springfield","title":"For What It’s Worth","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0011Z76UA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0011Z76UA"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"Once Upon A Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D4N94QH6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0D4N94QH6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000003YY8/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dffe019cc137bf2442013d5","%2F6196fc77fcb032b8eb633b34"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/numerology","keywords/energy","keywords/healing"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66b4a3569ebcaed11eff2560","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Aug 7 2024 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

One of the inspirations is the myth of Hyperborea, a legendary lost continent near the North Pole, rooted in ancient Greek mythology. Rollins suggested that the idea of Hyperborea continues to influence Russian ideology, particularly in the context of territorial claims and expansionism. He said many parts of the Arctic Circle are still unexplored, and there could be vast resources hidden beneath melting ice. His new novel also delves into the mysteries of lost libraries. It starts with the execution of a Vatican archivist within the shadow of the Kremlin, and this exposes a conspiracy going back three centuries-- to the bloody era of the Russian Tsars.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Shifting from fiction, he pointed out that various countries have been vying for control of the Arctic region. Russia has begun defending it specifically through military exercises involving thousands of troops and nuclear assets, he cited, adding that their fleet has &quot;over 40 icebreakers,&quot; in stark contrast to the US' two. The geopolitical stakes are compounded by China's investments in the region, aiming for easier access from the Pacific to the Atlantic, he continued. Rollins also detailed his access to the Vatican's archive and some of its hidden information. He divided their material into two categories-- ancient secrets, and modern secrets gleaned by the Vatican's vast intelligence agency that spans the globe.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Writer, researcher, and award-winning travel and documentary photographer \u003ca href=\"http://darraghmason.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Darragh Mason\u003c/a> hosts the podcast Spirit Box. In the latter half, he shared modern and folkloric accounts of the 'Dark Man' phenomenon as it relates to witchcraft and mysticism. The Dark Man could be thought of as &quot;a destructive force that reminds us that we are part of nature… it makes people understand that whatever you think about the world, all those things can be undermined in an instant,&quot; he stated. Mason shared that he became a believer in the phenomenon after an intense set of unlucky or unforeseen experiences while researching the jinn in Delhi that led up to a haunting, nightmarish encounter.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In Scottish folklore, the Dark Man appears as part animal, part human, and interrupts journeys, often in the form of a quest for a person's soul, he explained. In Irish folklore, he is considered a trickster figure, such as when a woman was cursed to live as a deer. According to Mason, the lore of the Dark Man can be found in the Scottish witch trials as a figure who appeared to people and lured them into magic. He also drew Dark Man parallels from the tales of the infamous Pied Piper of Hamelin, and Britain's \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring-heeled_Jack\" target=\"_blank\">Spring-Heeled Jack\u003c/a>, figures that invoke both terror and fascination.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the last half-hour, George featured an excerpt from his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2014-01-15-show/\" target=\"_blank\">1/15/14 interview\u003c/a> with William Henry on the 'Watchers.'\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

In the wake of Israel's assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Pelton speculated about Iran's possible retaliation. &quot;You're going to see a display of [Iran's] technology... but not necessarily a lot of widespread damage,&quot; he predicted, suggesting that Iran's capabilities are limited to missile launches that likely won't achieve significant results. Pelton highlighted the complexities of regime change in Iran, comparing the situation to historical events in Cuba. &quot;It would be a very, very brutal thing to change the regime in any of these places,&quot; he warned, yet he predicts young leadership could emerge from organizations like Hamas.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also criticized the Abraham Accords, calling them &quot;a fraud&quot; and stating that the peace agreements were a mere reorganization of alliances that excluded Palestinian interests. &quot;It didn't go anywhere, and it actually led to the tension that we saw in Gaza,&quot; Pelton claimed. At the same time, he defended Israel's actions against terrorist attacks, saying, &quot;In modern warfare, we [the US] do the same thing.&quot; Regarding the cycle of violence, he told listeners, &quot;We're going to see more and more conflict... as people battle for control over resources.&quot; Pelton expressed skepticism about further military actions. &quot;I think they're pushing their chips a little further in... but I hope... they start negotiating,&quot; he concluded.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, spiritual counselor Dr. \u003ca href=\"https://alishadas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alisha Das\u003c/a> shared her profound connection with angels. She recalled her first encounter with these &quot;beautiful, monolithic beings&quot; at just three years old, and described them as &quot;God's hands, eyes, and ears.&quot; Das claimed that people of all different cultural and spiritual backgrounds believe in some type of angel. &quot;In these divisive times, couldn't we all use something that unites us?&quot; she asked, noting a poll that showed 69% of Americans believe in these heavenly beings. Her personal journey with the higher realm involved a miraculous recovery from aggressive cancer, where she attributed her healing to divine intervention. Das believes everyone has at least one guardian angel, and acknowledging them strengthens their influence. &quot;They can help us a lot more if we connect with them,&quot; she explained. According to her, support is available to all, and she urged people to ask for help and be attuned to the subtle signs they may receive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Das spoke about the best ways to communicate with specific helpers, who can be called upon by name. &quot;What's even more efficacious is to call them by intention,&quot; she remarked. Regarding the nature of fallen angels, she described how &quot;it's so darn easy&quot; to be deceived by their magnetic charm, but calling on an archangel can offer protection. The conversation then turned to the role of angels in death, and Das assured listeners how &quot;there is an angel that guides us across the golden bridge.&quot; She also recalled witnessing a UFO in the form of a glowing orb that instructed her to connect with higher beings. It was an experience for which she's eternally grateful. &quot;Angels have never let me down,&quot; she declared. &quot;If you knew the extent of angelic health and love for you, it would blow your mind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>\u003cem>Steve Kates, a.k.a.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

She referred to eighth-house individuals as &quot;phoenixes,&quot; highlighting their resilience and healing abilities stemming from early life losses. In contrast, those in the twelfth house resemble &quot;fallen angels,&quot; often feeling out of place and spiritually different from their families, expressing a sense of being &quot;from another world.&quot; Turner-Schott recounted her own spiritual awakening at age 16 when one night she witnessed a &quot;glowing ball of light&quot; that ignited her fascination with astrology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She highlighted the importance of lunar nodes in understanding one's direction in life. &quot;The north node is your soul's mission in this lifetime,&quot; Turner-Schott explained. &quot;It represents what you are here to learn.&quot; On the other hand, the south node reveals the important lessons we've already received. She also shared a reading she did for a young boy at the request of his family. The child was drawing strange images and telling his parents of a man standing at the foot of his bed. Turner-Schott soon discovered he was an eighth-house person. &quot;He had spiritual gifts that he was born with, but no one was understanding him, and he had a fascination with death and the soul and the afterlife,&quot; she recalled.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

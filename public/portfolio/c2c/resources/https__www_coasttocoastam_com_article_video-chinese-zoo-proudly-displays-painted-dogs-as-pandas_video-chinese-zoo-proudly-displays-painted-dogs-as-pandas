Waldman, a successful broadcast journalist, and his mother, Karmela Waldman, a psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor, have embarked on a true crime podcast called \u003ca href=\"https://survivingthesurvivor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Surviving the Survivor\u003c/a>. He joined guest host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Richard Syrett\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Twitter\u003c/u>\u003c/a>) to delve into true crime cases they have covered and what it's like working on a podcast together as a mother and son team. He shared his mother's Holocaust survival story when at just four and a half, she was separated from her family and hidden by a Catholic nun in Yugoslavia. After surviving numerous atrocities and eventually reuniting with her mother, she went on to live a life of resilience, optimism, and humor, despite immense personal losses, including the death of a son, Waldman revealed. This experience, combined with her work as a therapist, enables her to provide unique insights into the psychology of both victims and criminals on their podcast, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Waldman provided a detailed account of the Dan Markel case, beginning with Markel's background as a Harvard-educated law professor at Florida State University. He was married to Wendy Adelson, and after their relationship deteriorated, they engaged in a bitter custody battle over their two children. On July 18, 2014, Markel was shot twice in the head outside his home in Tallahassee, following a gym visit. Though he initially survived the attack, he succumbed to his injuries the next day. Investigators had little evidence initially, but they eventually traced the crime to two hitmen, Sigfredo Garcia, and Luis Rivera, connected to Wendy's brother, Charlie Adelson, and his ex-girlfriend, Katie McBanua.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Waldman, the case remains complex, largely due to the involvement of multiple family members, including Wendy, Charlie, and their overbearing mother, Donna Adelson. Wendy had expressed dissatisfaction with living in Tallahassee and was influenced by her mother, who strongly disliked Markel. The investigation uncovered connections between the hitmen and the Adelson family, with Charlie convicted in 2023 for orchestrating the murder-for-hire plot. However, questions remain about Wendy's involvement, as she has not been charged despite suspicions surrounding her behavior and statements to the police shortly after the murder. Donna Adelson was recently arrested and is awaiting trial, which has been delayed due to legal complications involving her attorney. Waldman also reported on the murders of a wealthy Toronto couple, Honey and Barry Sherman.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Avery from California shared a paranormal experience involving his grandmother's house, where he saw a projection of Native American cave paintings on the wall. According to Avery, his father confirmed he had a similar experience in the same house, leading them to theorize about the location's history. Robert from New Orleans recounted a story about working overnight at an old hotel where he experienced a strange water leak incident. The water leak continued even after shutting off the valves, and the guest in the room, an amateur ghost hunter, found it amusing, he recalled. Joe from Monterey, California, discussed his experiences with astral plane encounters, including being bitten by an astral body and waking up paralyzed. He shared his belief in the power of calling on the armies of God to protect against demonic and extraterrestrial entities.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren. He served nine years in the U.S. Naval Reserve.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"/pages/about\">About Coast to Coast AM\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"/calendar/\">George's Calendar\u003c/a>\u003c/p>"}]},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["coast to coast am","radio","ufos","creatures","extraterrestrial","supernatural","myths","legends","monsters","space","universe","science","mystery","sci-fi","george noory","ian punnett","george knapp","art bell","somewhere in time"]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"","id":"%2F5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","source_credit":"","title":"George Noory","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","use_caption":false}},"primary_video":{"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"author_name":"","author_url":"","height":0,"thumbnail_height":0,"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"title":"","width":0},"embed_type":"","html":"","provider":"","rendering_hint":"","url":""}},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"george-noory"},"source":{"type":"plain","value":" "},"source_url":{"type":"plain","value":""},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Coast to Coast AM Radio\u003c/p>\n\n"},"title":{"type":"title","value":"George Noory"}},"ingestion":{"external_url":"","feed_content_id":"/content/george-noory","feed_partner_content":false,"feed_permalink":"https:/www.coasttocoastam.com/page/george-noory","feed_type":"","feed_vendor":"C2C"},"summary":{"author":"Coast to Coast AM Staff","description":"Coast to Coast AM Radio","image":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"caption":"","link":"","new_tab":false,"source_credit":"","title":"George Noory","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","use_caption":false},"keywords":["coast to coast am","radio","ufos","creatures","extraterrestrial","supernatural","myths","legends","monsters","space","universe","science","mystery","sci-fi","george noory","ian punnett","george knapp","art bell","somewhere in time"],"primary_slug":"george-noory","slugs":["george-noory"],"sponsored":false,"title":"George Noory"},"targeting":{"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"publish_date":1580474700000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/COAST-PR (15194)","syndication":{"publish_origin":"brands/COAST-PR (15194)","refs":{}},"targets":[{"id":"WlGey","operator":"OR","readonly":false,"remove":false,"update":false,"what":["coast-categories/host-george-noory"],"where":["collections/Coast to Coast AM","brands/COAST-PR (15194)","collections/Coast to Coast AM Host"],"workflow":""}]}},"pub_start":1580474700000,"type":"content:coast-to-coast-article","summary":{"title":"George Noory","description":"Coast to Coast AM Radio","image":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3"}}]}}],"lookup":["publish_origin:brands/COAST-PR (15194)","id:/66f60080d0457f3b3f28d71e","slug:2024-10-01-show","slug:2024-10-01-show","keyword:keywords/natural remedies","keyword:keywords/cosmic events"]}}],"resume":{"id":"ID:articles-upcoming-shows-feed","context":{"\u003clocale>":"en-US","\u003cupcoming_pub_start>":1728740888000,"\u003cupcoming_pub_after>":1727532000000,"\u003cslug>":"video-chinese-zoo-proudly-displays-painted-dogs-as-pandas"},"size":4,"from":"eyJza2lwIjo0LCJjdXJzb3JzIjp7IkFxc0dRIjoiZXlKdlptWnpaWFFpT2pSOSJ9LCJlbmRzIjp7fX0=","scopes":[]}}},{"id":"BrqY4","region":"right:dynamic","type":"ad","ordinal":2,"value":{"ad_split":0,"position":"3309"},"tags":[],"schedule":null},{"id":"sd9O9","region":"right:dynamic","type":"ad","ordinal":3,"value":{"ad_split":0,"position":"5052"},"tags":[],"schedule":null},{"id":"86OYs","region":"right:dynamic","type":"generic","ordinal":4,"value":{"title":null},"tags":["display-hints/coast-zone"],"schedule":{"begin":0,"end":4115978604802}},{"id":"ad:bottom-leaderboard","region":"ad:bottom-leaderboard","type":"ad","ordinal":0,"value":{"ad_split":0,"position":"3306"},"tags":[],"schedule":null}]}}],["itemloader-video-chinese-zoo-proudly-displays-painted-dogs-as-pandas",{"data":{"ref_id":"%2F66ef50f626c0998a1b19766c","type":"content:coast-to-coast-article","payload":{"canonical_url":"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/video-chinese-zoo-proudly-displays-painted-dogs-as-pandas/","cuser":"user/ldap/1138274","fields":{"author":{"type":"author","value":[]},"blocks":{"type":"flex","value":[{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003cem>By Alec Fernandes\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>After a zoo in China was caught painting \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/video-chinese-zoos-panda-exhibit-features-dogs-dyed-black-and-white/\" target=\"_blank\">dogs to look like pandas\u003c/a> back in May, a different zoo has embraced the odd practice.

Waldman, a successful broadcast journalist, and his mother, Karmela Waldman, a psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor, have embarked on a true crime podcast called \u003ca href=\"https://survivingthesurvivor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Surviving the Survivor\u003c/a>. He joined guest host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Richard Syrett\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Twitter\u003c/u>\u003c/a>) to delve into true crime cases they have covered and what it's like working on a podcast together as a mother and son team. He shared his mother's Holocaust survival story when at just four and a half, she was separated from her family and hidden by a Catholic nun in Yugoslavia. After surviving numerous atrocities and eventually reuniting with her mother, she went on to live a life of resilience, optimism, and humor, despite immense personal losses, including the death of a son, Waldman revealed. This experience, combined with her work as a therapist, enables her to provide unique insights into the psychology of both victims and criminals on their podcast, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Waldman provided a detailed account of the Dan Markel case, beginning with Markel's background as a Harvard-educated law professor at Florida State University. He was married to Wendy Adelson, and after their relationship deteriorated, they engaged in a bitter custody battle over their two children. On July 18, 2014, Markel was shot twice in the head outside his home in Tallahassee, following a gym visit. Though he initially survived the attack, he succumbed to his injuries the next day. Investigators had little evidence initially, but they eventually traced the crime to two hitmen, Sigfredo Garcia, and Luis Rivera, connected to Wendy's brother, Charlie Adelson, and his ex-girlfriend, Katie McBanua.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Waldman, the case remains complex, largely due to the involvement of multiple family members, including Wendy, Charlie, and their overbearing mother, Donna Adelson. Wendy had expressed dissatisfaction with living in Tallahassee and was influenced by her mother, who strongly disliked Markel. The investigation uncovered connections between the hitmen and the Adelson family, with Charlie convicted in 2023 for orchestrating the murder-for-hire plot. However, questions remain about Wendy's involvement, as she has not been charged despite suspicions surrounding her behavior and statements to the police shortly after the murder. Donna Adelson was recently arrested and is awaiting trial, which has been delayed due to legal complications involving her attorney. Waldman also reported on the murders of a wealthy Toronto couple, Honey and Barry Sherman.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Avery from California shared a paranormal experience involving his grandmother's house, where he saw a projection of Native American cave paintings on the wall. According to Avery, his father confirmed he had a similar experience in the same house, leading them to theorize about the location's history. Robert from New Orleans recounted a story about working overnight at an old hotel where he experienced a strange water leak incident. The water leak continued even after shutting off the valves, and the guest in the room, an amateur ghost hunter, found it amusing, he recalled. Joe from Monterey, California, discussed his experiences with astral plane encounters, including being bitten by an astral body and waking up paralyzed.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Waldman, a successful broadcast journalist, and his mother, Karmela Waldman, a psychotherapist and Holocaust survivor, have embarked on a true crime podcast called \u003ca href=\"https://survivingthesurvivor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Surviving the Survivor\u003c/a>. He joined guest host \u003ca href=\"https://www.strangeplanet.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Richard Syrett\u003c/u>\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/richardsyrett\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Twitter\u003c/u>\u003c/a>) to delve into true crime cases they have covered and what it's like working on a podcast together as a mother and son team. He shared his mother's Holocaust survival story when at just four and a half, she was separated from her family and hidden by a Catholic nun in Yugoslavia. After surviving numerous atrocities and eventually reuniting with her mother, she went on to live a life of resilience, optimism, and humor, despite immense personal losses, including the death of a son, Waldman revealed. This experience, combined with her work as a therapist, enables her to provide unique insights into the psychology of both victims and criminals on their podcast, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Waldman provided a detailed account of the Dan Markel case, beginning with Markel's background as a Harvard-educated law professor at Florida State University. He was married to Wendy Adelson, and after their relationship deteriorated, they engaged in a bitter custody battle over their two children. On July 18, 2014, Markel was shot twice in the head outside his home in Tallahassee, following a gym visit. Though he initially survived the attack, he succumbed to his injuries the next day. Investigators had little evidence initially, but they eventually traced the crime to two hitmen, Sigfredo Garcia, and Luis Rivera, connected to Wendy's brother, Charlie Adelson, and his ex-girlfriend, Katie McBanua.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Waldman, the case remains complex, largely due to the involvement of multiple family members, including Wendy, Charlie, and their overbearing mother, Donna Adelson. Wendy had expressed dissatisfaction with living in Tallahassee and was influenced by her mother, who strongly disliked Markel. The investigation uncovered connections between the hitmen and the Adelson family, with Charlie convicted in 2023 for orchestrating the murder-for-hire plot. However, questions remain about Wendy's involvement, as she has not been charged despite suspicions surrounding her behavior and statements to the police shortly after the murder. Donna Adelson was recently arrested and is awaiting trial, which has been delayed due to legal complications involving her attorney. Waldman also reported on the murders of a wealthy Toronto couple, Honey and Barry Sherman.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Avery from California shared a paranormal experience involving his grandmother's house, where he saw a projection of Native American cave paintings on the wall. According to Avery, his father confirmed he had a similar experience in the same house, leading them to theorize about the location's history. Robert from New Orleans recounted a story about working overnight at an old hotel where he experienced a strange water leak incident. The water leak continued even after shutting off the valves, and the guest in the room, an amateur ghost hunter, found it amusing, he recalled. Joe from Monterey, California, discussed his experiences with astral plane encounters, including being bitten by an astral body and waking up paralyzed. He shared his belief in the power of calling on the armies of God to protect against demonic and extraterrestrial entities. Joe suggested traditional paraphernalia like garlic and crucifixes are effective against astral vampires.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Surviving-Survivor-Conversation-Holocaust-Therapist/dp/B0D3VMVM2T/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Surviving the Survivor\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"Livin' Thing","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136LM0C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136LM0C"},{"artist":"Esther Phillips","title":"Try Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08M9D8VRM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08M9D8VRM"},{"artist":"Andy Gibb","title":"Shadow Dancing","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07B4RHZGX/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Dr. Hook","title":"Sylvia's Mother","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137ZBV2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137ZBV2"},{"artist":"JD Souther","title":"You're Only Lonely","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138CYZC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Joss Stone","title":"Right To Be Wrong","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SXKN2E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SXKN2E"},{"artist":"Ram Jam","title":"Black Betty","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004LF8P5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004LF8P5C"},{"artist":"The Sweet","title":"Fox On The Run","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TRTQV8/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Stevie Wonder","title":"Uptight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V6U904/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Dionne Warwick","title":"Walk on By","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002C79B9U/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002C79B9U"},{"artist":"Badfinger","title":"No Matter What","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00GXSBI7M/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00GXSBI7M"},{"artist":"Sheryl Crow","title":"Real Gone","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IEWR67U/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01IEWR67U"},{"artist":"Joe Jackson","title":"Is She Really Going Out With Him?","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W177XK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W177XK"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night (Barking At Airplanes)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B000TERJ06/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66c7d9d347e95a462f608dac","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/true crime","keywords/podcast"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f7dfc2e621497949fda515","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 27 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f7dfd5e621497949fda516","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 27 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f7dfe3e621497949fda517","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 27 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f7dff3e621497949fda518","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 27 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Microphone and Beauty abstract wave technology background with blue led light. podcast, live, streaming concept. 3d rendering.","id":"%2F66ecc677eca89f2ec73a6b34","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66ecc677eca89f2ec73a6b34","source_credit":"Imagesrouges / iStock / Getty Images","title":"Microphone and Beauty abstract wave technology background with blue led light. podcast, live, streaming concept.","url":"asset://assets.getty/66ecc677eca89f2ec73a6b34","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1727445600000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-09-27-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Joel Waldman delved into true crime cases covered on his podcast, \u003ca href=\"https://survivingthesurvivor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Surviving the Survivor\u003c/a>, which he co-hosts with his mother, Karm Waldman.

With over 33 years of research, she has discovered that this IGS serves as a personal &quot;divine blueprint&quot;, tracking thoughts and providing signals that help navigate life's challenges. DeBrucke revealed that her background was marked by adversity. &quot;I had a pretty traumatic upbringing… everything you could think of,&quot; she recounted. &quot;I was lost. I was sabotaging my life.&quot; Her turning point came when a friend introduced her to a cassette tape by Abraham Hicks discussing the law of attraction. This revelation led her to explore the concept of IGS. DeBrucke elaborated on the system's connection to sensations in different regions of the body. &quot;The throat [signals] when you're undermining your own self. The chest is daily information about the past, present, and future thoughts, but the solar plexus is a belief system that's not true for you,&quot; DeBrucke explained. She emphasized that feelings of tension, such as fear and anxiety, indicate that the thoughts we are holding may not align with our true selves.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>DeBrucke's philosophy encourages individuals to &quot;get the mind out of the way&quot; and embrace a state of flow, which she defines as a natural energy that facilitates ease and synchronicity in life. &quot;When you get up in the morning, if everything goes right, you hit all the green lights, there are no lines in the stores, that's flow,&quot; she said. &quot;Your whole life can look like that.&quot; She also believes divine timing plays a crucial role in this process. &quot;Procrastination is a closing experience,&quot; DeBrucke stated, noting it as a signal that &quot;the timing isn't right.&quot; By learning to listen to their internal guidance, individuals can better navigate their lives and make decisions that align with their true purpose. She shared inspiring stories of people who have transformed their lives by following their IGS. One poignant example involved a man who transitioned from being an attorney to pursuing his passion for painting, ultimately leading to a deeper connection with his father, who also discovered his own creative desires.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, investigative journalist \u003ca href=\"https://cherylljones.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cheryll Jones\u003c/a> presented her interview with spiritual teacher and shaman \u003ca href=\"http://aniavedissian.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ani Avedissian\u003c/a>, who delved into the intricate world of black magic. Avedissian described her formative years, stating that her family &quot;comes from a long bloodline of Armenian shamans.&quot; This lineage, coupled with her father's resistance to British colonialism in Cyprus, formed her understanding of the dark forces at play in the world. She elaborated on the distinction between black and white magic, explaining, &quot;Black magic is setting an evil intention, and white magic is sending a harmonious intention.&quot; Evil energy, she claimed, is pervasive in modern society, particularly through what she terms &quot;mass psychosis&quot; or &quot;mass hypnotism.&quot; Avedissian argued that the COVID-19 pandemic exemplified this phenomenon, labeling it a &quot;hoax&quot; that served a &quot;much more sinister agenda.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Avedissian emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong connection to the divine to resist the influences of black magic. &quot;One fully self-realized person could hold back half the forces of Lucifer on their own,&quot; she said. She also delved into the relationship between black magic and modern technological advancements, particularly artificial intelligence. &quot;Technology is morally neutral. You know, it's not going to do anything on its own. So it's a question of who runs it,&quot; she asserted. Avedissian believes that rather than fearing AI, humanity should focus on elevating its spiritual awareness to prevent it from being misused. When asked about the worst applications of black magic today, she cited mass brainwashing and depopulation as particularly alarming. &quot;There is a certain type of black magic practiced by the darker elements of the establishment that is a blood magic,&quot; she explained, suggesting that those who engage in such practices are making deadly sacrifices in service to darker forces.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final 15 minutes of the show featured an interview from \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2023-08-01-show/\" target=\"_blank\">8/1/23\u003c/a>, when George Noory spoke with \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/gillis-nathaniel-99367/\" target=\"_blank\">Nathaniel Gillis\u003c/a> about demonology and how it pertains to modern spiritual warfare, including exorcism and alien abduction.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://myheartbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Soul-Discovering-Transform-Fulfillment/dp/0615365167/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Smart Soul\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Your-Inner-GPS-Happiness-Satisfaction/dp/1608684121/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Your Inner GPS\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny G","title":"Songbird","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004LHQ318/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004LHQ318"},{"artist":"Roy Orbison","title":"In Dreams","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00Y1LRY8K/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Van Halen","title":"Right Now","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AOA8E/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Smiths","title":"How Soon Is Now?","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B005TLYG7I/ctoc/?trackAsin=B005TLYG7I"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Rhythm of the Wilderness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GN14UY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GN14UY"},{"artist":"The Rolling Stones","title":"As Tears Go By","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00SVEFN18/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00SVEFN18"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Ghost Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM878/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM878"},{"artist":"Keely Smith","title":"That Old Black Magic","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00LM117MG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00LM117MG"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Modern Crusaders","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCW9A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCW9A"},{"artist":"Tommy Edwards","title":"It's All In The Game","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07JVRKQY8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07JVRKQY8"},{"artist":"Wilco","title":"Shouldn't Be Ashamed","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VX97CXD/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VX97CXD"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Riders on the Storm","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00BZQ58OG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00BZQ58OG"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Age Of Loneliness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB3JU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB3JU"},{"artist":"Bobby Darin","title":"The Curtain Falls","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07BLK7YPH/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07BLK7YPH"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00dd02537fd678a3ecefab","%2F5e007758cc137bf244201ad8"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/mental guidance","keywords/black magic"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f68bd6a320330c748e5d12","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 26 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f68be3a320330c748e5d13","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 26 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f68bf0a320330c748e5d14","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 26 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f68c07a320330c748e5d15","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 26 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Human head and compass.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

In the first half, he shared insights into the evolution and future of biotechnology and the new medical treatments it may offer. Harris traced the roots of biotechnology back to 1976, underscoring its significance in drug discovery and development. He described biotechnology as &quot;the application of technology for biological processes,&quot; highlighting its transformative potential in areas like gene therapy and protein manipulation. When asked about the industry's future, Harris expressed optimism, noting that &quot;new technologies are arising, which are enabling us to do even more interesting things&quot; for patient care, including CAR T-cell immune therapy and bespoke cancer vaccines.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines, he remarked that going from a standing start to having a vaccine within 12 months was &quot;completely astonishing.&quot; Harris credits the advances in biotechnology to academic scientists and venture capital's support, emphasizing their dual role in research and commercialization. He discussed the evolving landscape of biotech and its implications for diseases like multiple sclerosis and lupus, and the need for innovative treatments, stating, &quot;We need to look at those patients who do not do well on the current drugs and find some new ones.&quot; While acknowledging the role of artificial intelligence in drug discovery, Harris cautioned against overhyping it, saying, &quot;AI is really large scale data analytics... but drug discovery and drug development is an experimental science.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Board-certified in Internal Medicine, \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/simmons-geoffrey-6903/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Geoffrey Simmons\u003c/a> shared his transformative journey from Darwinian supporter to believer in intelligent design, in the show's latter half. &quot;It's becoming more and more obvious that complexity upon complexity... couldn't have come about by accident,&quot; and that the evidence for design is overwhelming, he commented. Yet, he noted apparent flaws in human design, and pondered why people are susceptible to diseases and congenital conditions if there is a perfect designer or brilliant engineer behind their creation. Simmons referenced the biblical verse from Isaiah 55:8, citing, &quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts,&quot; to explore the idea that human suffering may have deeper purposes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He argued that systems within the human body with millions of interacting cells are too intricate to have arisen randomly. The multitude of unique life forms on our planet and their complexities also suggest the hand of intelligent design, he added. For people who believe in Darwin, &quot;I think they have another reason... It's not a scientific argument.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he discussed the importance of elastin fiber in the body and how it's essential for good health. This often-overlooked substance impacts vital functions like breathing and blood circulation. He explained that elastin production begins to decline around age 25, which increases susceptibility to chronic inflammation and various health conditions like heart disease. &quot;Elastin fiber is probably the most complicated material in the human body,&quot; he added, likening it to the wire rope in a suspension bridge that requires constant maintenance to avoid collapse. Mulhall noted that lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking can accelerate elastin degradation.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Two substances – EDTA and polyphenols – have shown promise in restoring elastin, he reported, and recent discoveries by researchers have led to clinical trials aimed at repairing elastin in arteries and skin. He also addressed the potential for these treatments to positively impact conditions like vascular dementia and senescence. &quot;Restoring flexibility in your arteries can have a dramatic effect&quot; with profound implications for longevity and overall health, he remarked. &quot;We're on the cusp of a revolution in healthcare,&quot; Mulhall continued, suggesting that the field could evolve into a multi-trillion-dollar healthcare industry, with companies like Elastrin Therapeutics and Nectero Medical leading the charge in clinical trials.

In the latter half, he discussed ET abductions, military involvement, hybrids, and the power of the Reptilians. His long-standing fascination with alien abduction phenomena intensified after a life-altering ET encounter in 1990. He differentiated between various ET beings, particularly the notorious Reptilians, whom he described as having multiple origins including subterrestrial (living underground), extraterrestrial, and interdimensional. &quot;Some of the abducting beings commonly referred to as Greys... actually work for the Reptilians,&quot; he commented.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>While acknowledging that not all Reptilians are malevolent, he warned that the dangerous ones are &quot;troublemakers&quot; with a history of violence and abuse that involves the manipulation of human souls and consciousness for their own gain, as well as the ability to alter people's dream states. Bartley suggested that the Reptilians are engaged in an ongoing war with other ET races.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Delving into the intersections of UFO phenomena and historical military secrecy, he cited the Rendlesham Forest incident as a highly significant case, where &quot;40 or more Air Force personnel&quot; encountered a landed craft and &quot;three alien beings&quot; face-to-face. According to Bartley, some of the Air Force personnel were drugged and kidnapped, and then taken to an underground base where they interacted with an alien presence. He believes that there has been military involvement with alien technology since the 1940s, which was first developed from crash retrievals. Further, the Russians and Chinese have their own recovered alien craft.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

On October 2, 2024, an annular solar eclipse will occur, primarily visible in southern Chile and Argentina, as well as parts of the South Pacific. He emphasized that every solar eclipse is a new moon, marking the start of a monthly cycle, and highlighted the ongoing influence of Chiron (known as the &quot;wisest of the centaurs&quot; in mythology), which he described as the intense energy we're still dealing with that was present during the major eclipse back in April. Chiron has a significance on major political figures such as Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris, who all have strong Chiron placements in their birth charts, he continued. &quot;Chiron is supposed to show mentor qualities,&quot; Lerner noted, outlining its role as a catalyst for higher consciousness.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He explained how the equinoxes, especially the recent one marking the start of autumn, can intensify worldly events, stating, &quot;Depending on the chart for the beginning of the season, we get added intensity... around the planet,&quot; including such things as warfare or extreme weather. Further, he clarified that planetary alignments influence our lives through &quot;synchronicity,&quot; not direct physical effects. It's about archetypes and themes that are constantly working inside you, he explained. Lerner delved into the cyclical nature of astrology, specifically the 83-year cycle of Jupiter, which he believes reveals patterns in world events. He pointed out, &quot;We are repeating vibrations from the World War II time period,&quot; drawing parallels between contemporary conflicts and historical events, specifically the crises in Ukraine and Israel.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, UFO investigator \u003ca href=\"https://sedonanewagestore.com/psychics/melinda\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Melinda Leslie\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cu>,\u003c/u> the owner of UFO Sighting Tours in Sedona, talked about strange aerial phenomena (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/exclusive-video-inexplicable-uaps-captured-near-sedona/\" target=\"_blank\">view footage\u003c/a>) seen over the Sedona skies and their possible connection to a purported underground military base. She also delved into paranormal mysteries at the Bradshaw Ranch near Sedona. On her tours, they use military night vision goggles, which greatly enhance the view of the skies, and participants often observe unexplained structured objects, triangles, and cylindrical shapes. Leslie recalled a particularly active night, stating, &quot;It was absolutely insane... 45 minutes straight&quot; of sightings. Addressing skeptics, she emphasized, &quot;Drones are actually illegal over Sedona at night,&quot; and they can separate out which craft are military as they have specific blinking patterns.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Some believe that the Sedona area's unique electromagnetic fields and its designation as a vortex location attracts UFOs, and there is also the long-standing lore of the local Native Americans and their contact with the &quot;Star People,&quot; she recounted. Speaking of the mysterious Bradshaw Ranch, which has been compared to Skinwalker Ranch, she stated, &quot;It's known for a lot of paranormal activity… there's light anomalies, spatial anomalies, and portals,&quot; as well as consistent Bigfoot activity. Leslie said she is part of a research team investigating a vast tunnel system beneath the region, which includes evidence from ground-penetrating radar showing a &quot;50-foot wide tunnel&quot; likely linked to covert military operations. At this base, it's possible that ETs are working together with the US military, she suggested.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://theskylive.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Steve Kates\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GN1C9C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GN1C9C"},{"artist":"Nat King Cole","title":"Autumn Leaves","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000THI6LE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000THI6LE"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001380KQC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001380KQC"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Don’t Fear The Reaper","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138EX1K/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K60GZNE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"Ella Fitzgerald","title":"Autumn In New York","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BGQLQDS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07BGQLQDS"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Hey Nineteen","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V697R0/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"I Love You I’ll Kill You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDF2DS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDF2DS"},{"artist":"John Coltrane","title":"Autumn Serenade","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NZ0WKO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZ0WKO"},{"artist":"A Tribe Called Quest","title":"Moms","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001458NRM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001458NRM"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"Light My Fire","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AYH4G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AYH4G"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCZ0G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCZ0G"},{"artist":"Echo & The Bunnymen","title":"Lips Like Sugar","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122B4T6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122B4T"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00224e537fd678a3ece845","%2F5e00b9e1cc137bf244201ce3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/astrology","keywords/solar eclipse","keywords/UFOs","keywords/Sedona"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f2950a1ed6be3556015ec3","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 23 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f295181ed6be3556015ec4","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 23 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f295291ed6be3556015ec5","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 23 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66f295361ed6be3556015ec6","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 23 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"The sun is obscured by the moon during an annular solar eclipse in Tokyo, Japan.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He pointed to the infamous Roswell incident as a pivotal moment when the American public's trust began to erode. &quot;There was a flying saucer that crashed, and it hit all the newspapers, then the government said, 'No, sorry, it was a weather balloon',&quot; Levenda explained. According to him, there needs to be a shift in the top-level narrative when addressing UAP. &quot;Let's change the conversation from, 'Are there UFOs?' Let's start from the agreement that they exist,&quot; he asserted. Yet Levenda acknowledged that progress is happening, however slowly. He recounted a pivotal moment when he found himself sitting across from political advisor John Podesta. &quot;By the middle of 2015, we were sitting in Washington, DC,&quot; he shared. &quot;I'm realizing, okay, it's working… we're getting somewhere with this,&quot; in reference to his quest for increased government transparency.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Levenda stated that a religious agenda among American politicians is stifling the investigation of UAP. He claimed that certain members of Congress have stood in the way of disclosure by arguing that such phenomena are heretical and shouldn't be explored. Levenda pointed to countries that have historically been atheist, such as Russia and China, as being more open to interacting with UFOs. He recounted stories of Russian troops who, realizing that UFOs were attracted to the sound of military operations, began to deliberately create noise to see if the crafts would respond. This led to the military experimenting with different aerial maneuvers that mirrored those of the UFOs, a strategy that Levenda described as a primitive form of communication.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, legendary remote viewing expert \u003ca href=\"https://centerlane-rv.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Skip Atwater\u003c/a> recounted Pat Price's story of viewing UFO bases. &quot;Price came up with this idea about him remote viewing UFOs, but that wasn't something that I was involved with myself,&quot; Atwater explained. In discussing Price's extraordinary abilities, Atwater revealed that Price had conducted remote viewing sessions without adhering to strict protocols. This freewheeling approach often led to astonishing results, such as identifying underground bases in various locations around the world. Atwater described how, years later, he and his team sought to validate these findings through Project 8200, where they employed other remote viewers to independently verify the findings.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Atwater noted that Price had expressed a feeling of being observed during one of his sessions, a phenomenon that resonated with Atwater's own experiences. &quot;I think they may see me here. Maybe I should go someplace else for a while,&quot; Price had stated. Another compelling story that Atwater shared was about Joe McMoneagle, a talented remote viewer who had participated in Project Stargate.

Malik revealed that &quot;with the advent and pervasiveness of the internet, scams are reaching out to all of us,&quot; noting that even seasoned experts can fall victim to deception. &quot;I've been scammed,&quot; he admitted &quot;I know what that feeling is like of shame, and you should never feel ashamed.&quot; He discussed how sophisticated schemes often mimic legitimate communications, making it challenging to discern what's real. Malik stressed the importance of being vigilant and highly skeptical when it comes to all communications on the web. He emphasized that &quot;we have to maintain a state of readiness and preparedness.&quot; The conversation also touched on the security of cloud services like iCloud, with Malik commenting that while Apple generally offers high security, &quot;there is no perfect security.&quot; He told listeners, &quot;There's almost always a direct trade-off between convenience and functionality versus security.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Malik, reflecting on the prevalence of cybercrime, noted, &quot;A significant amount of it is coming from people who feel they have no other choice to make money.&quot; He described receiving a targeted email that included his personal information, such as his name, phone number, and address. The email contained an extortion note accusing Malik of visiting inappropriate websites and threatened to expose him unless he paid a sum of money. He detailed the steps he took to analyze the email and attachment, ultimately discovering it was an attempt to scare him rather than a legitimate threat. &quot;Emails are getting better and better and closer and closer to looking like something legit,&quot; he warned. Malik advised listeners to &quot;hover your mouse over the email [links] without clicking&quot; to verify URLs, and check the email header for inconsistencies. He also urged everyone to use unique passwords and consider passphrases, as &quot;a 20- or 25-character-long passphrase... is much different&quot; from a standard password in terms of security.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, paranormal researcher \u003ca href=\"https://sspri.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Patty Valdez\u003c/a> spoke about her years of strange experiences and her team's \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/video-light-anomaly-appears-inside-washington-state-museum/\" target=\"_blank\">video footage\u003c/a> of an unexplainable light anomaly. Valdez is the founder of South Sound Paranormal Research in Washington State, and she recounted the group's journey since 2006. &quot;We set up a team... [focused on] documenting what we were getting, not just running around,&quot; Valdez explained. The conversation then shifted to a remarkable illumination captured at the Lewis County Historical Museum, which she described as a &quot;phenomenal catch.&quot; She outlined her team's rigorous analysis of the footage, stating, &quot;We tried every which way possible to recreate that... but that beam of light is square,&quot; rather than a round orb, which is more commonly witnessed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Valdez also shared a chilling experience from the USS Turner Joy, a decommissioned naval destroyer turned museum. &quot;We were the first paranormal team invited in,&quot; she enthused, sharing with listeners an eerie moment when music inexplicably blared from a non-functioning speaker. &quot;It was really loud,&quot; Valdez recalled, describing how it frightened even the crew. The conversation also touched on her group's outreach programs, which include camps for kids to dispel fears about the paranormal. &quot;We allow them to use equipment to pick up things,&quot; she said while stressing the importance of educating young minds. Valdez uses various methods to capture signs of the strange and bizarre, but prefers recording sound. She admitted that &quot;audio seems to be the way to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"The Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B083ZLS4BQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Marshall Tucker Band","title":"Fire on the Mountain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00K138IXC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00K138IXC"},{"artist":"Black Oak Arkansas","title":"Jim Dandy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003SAGUOE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003SAGUOE"},{"artist":"The Ozark Mountain Daredevils","title":"If You Want To Get To Heaven","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W2J4JY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W2J4JY"},{"artist":"Lynyrd Skynyrd","title":"Saturday Night Special","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V68OII/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000V68OII"},{"artist":"The Amazing Rhythm Aces","title":"Third Rate Romance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00J84EQGI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00J84EQGI"},{"artist":"Georgia Satellites","title":"Keep Your Hands to Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001MCWSDW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001MCWSDW"},{"artist":"Blackfoot","title":"Highway Song","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001229HGS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001229HGS"},{"artist":"The Outlaws","title":"(Ghost) Riders In The Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0014LPZNQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0014LPZNQ"},{"artist":"Bo Diddley","title":"Pretty Thing","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07H12ZYCX/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07H12ZYCX"},{"artist":"Little Feat","title":"Oh, Atlanta","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001DPAW54/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001DPAW54"},{"artist":"The Charlie Daniels Band","title":"Long Haired Country Boy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137O6KO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137O6KO"},{"artist":"Stillwater","title":"Mindbender","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089R3P6HZ/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Marshall Tucker Band","title":"Heard It in a Love Song","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00K138JR2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00K138JR2"},{"artist":"38 Special","title":"Rockin' Into The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/Rockin-Into-Night-CD-vinyl-Cardboard/dp/B00IJLO2TC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07P19JR8X"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66ecaa3a0f48effc703d8348","%2F66ecab068341702dbaf886cf"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/cyber attacks","keywords/paranormal investigations"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eff520e50f0cc6e917d646","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Sep 21 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eff534e50f0cc6e917d647","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Sep 21 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eff545e50f0cc6e917d648","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Sep 21 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eff557e50f0cc6e917d649","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Sep 21 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Man in digital torrent","id":"%2F66ecb5f7e345a00775c3b3b0","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66ecb5f7e345a00775c3b3b0","source_credit":"John Lamb / The Image Bank / Getty Images","title":"Digtal identity","url":"asset://assets.getty/66ecb5f7e345a00775c3b3b0","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1726927200000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-09-21-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Malik, an expert in cybersecurity, discussed practical ways to protect ourselves from online threats.

Yater\u003c/a>, the marketing genius behind some of the biggest chocolate empires in the world. Yater is the only American to have managed all three major Belgian chocolate companies: Godiva, Leonidas, and KC Chocolatier. While at Godiva, he helped elevate chocolate's image from an everyday treat to something more upscale. &quot;We had to position chocolate as a special-occasion gift,&quot; he explained, noting how this confection &quot;activates the brain and creates sensory pleasures.&quot; According to Yater, &quot;There are more chocoholics than alcoholics these days.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Yater described his tenure at Godiva during the 1980s, a time when women were beginning to break into management roles. &quot;The Wall Street Journal coined the phrase the 'Godiva Girls',&quot; he said. These Godiva Girls were not just sales representatives — they were also a tight-knit community that embraced the idea of extraterrestrials. &quot;Many of the women had their own stories to tell,&quot; Yater recounted, revealing that some were even UFO abductees. He shared the story of &quot;Sweet Pea,&quot; who claimed to have flown in an alien craft. &quot;They taught her how to fly,&quot; Yater recalled, describing how she could manipulate the ship's speed by harmonizing with certain light-wave frequencies. &quot;We all knew that there was [life on] more than just Earth,&quot; he admitted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Yater also told listeners about his own encounters with the paranormal, recalling an unsettling experience with a poltergeist in his home. &quot;Every time I was gone, my house would burn down, or my house would flood,&quot; he shared. After several insurance claims, he sought help from a paranormal expert who revealed that he had a spirit of a young boy living between the walls of his dining room and living room. This spirit, feeling neglected during Yater's absences, would unleash chaos in his home. &quot;The entity was sad and lonely, and they got mad that I wasn't there,&quot; he speculated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half featured Open Lines, where listeners called in to discuss topics of interest. Yater joined in for the first part to answer questions from callers. Catherine from Canada asked him if any famous person has requested chocolate-covered ants for a party. He explained that while it's a fun idea, strict food regulations and inspections make it unlikely for his companies to produce such items.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mike from Denver praised Yater for his chocolate knowledge and asked about the evolution of marketing this treat. Yater explained how the product image has now shifted from being a luxury item to having health benefits. Bill from Florida shared a quick recipe for a chocolate soufflé using eggs and snack-pack pudding. Joseph from Monterey discussed the historical connection between chocolate and extraterrestrials, also referencing its significance in Mayan culture. He shared his personal experience with chocolate as a childhood staple, and linked it to endorphins and brain stimulation.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final hour of the program shifted away from the topic of chocolate. Steven from Washington State asked about distinguishing between haunted houses and spiritually active spaces. He also mentioned encountering a &quot;dark man&quot; figure. Ruth from Maryland recounted a recent experience with a pendulum at work, which was made of magnets. She described witnessing a spirit or orb emerging from the pendulum, comparing its size to a 10-gallon aquarium. Ruth speculated that there may be a connection between the pendulum's magnetic properties and the phenomena she observed.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Chocolate-Covered-Money-Marketing-Successful/dp/1637588070/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Chocolate Covered Money\u003c/a> \u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Led Zeppelin","title":"Stairway To Heaven","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M320QN4/ctoc"},{"artist":"Lynyrd Skynyrd","title":"Free Bird","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V616DS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000V616DS"},{"artist":"The Charlie Daniels Band","title":"The South's Gonna Do It Again","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137IEEI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137IEEI"},{"artist":"Little Feat","title":"Dixie Chicken","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0C25YC1ML/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Marshall Tucker Band","title":"Can't You See","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00K13F66Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00K13F66Y"},{"artist":"The Outlaws","title":"There Goes Another Love Song","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013DBYKI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0013DBYKI"},{"artist":"The Allman Brothers Band","title":"Whipping Post","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IJM42JU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01IJM42JU"},{"artist":"Molly Hatchet","title":"Flirtin' With Disaster","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136NMIC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136NMIC"},{"artist":"The Black Crowes","title":"Hard To Handle","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01FREZXKK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01FREZXKK"},{"artist":"The Allman Brothers Band","title":"Midnight Rider","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H14216Q/ctoc"},{"artist":"Blackfoot","title":"Train, Train","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122BEN2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122BEN2"},{"artist":"Wet Willie","title":"Keep On Smilin'","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZZIV2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZZIV2"},{"artist":"Ram Jam","title":"Black Betty","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004LF8P5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004LF8P5C"},{"artist":"Lynyrd Skynyrd","title":"Sweet Home Alabama","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V62T3Y/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66e369255ba6972e1bc89149","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/chocolate"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eea8ec35786334f0f1966d","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 20 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eea8fc35786334f0f1966e","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 20 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eea90a35786334f0f1966f","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 20 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66eea91935786334f0f19670","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 20 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Bitter chocolate bar in splaches of melted chocolate.

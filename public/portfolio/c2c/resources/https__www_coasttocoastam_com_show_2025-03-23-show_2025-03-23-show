block"><section class="coast-show-audiobox-component"></section><section class="audiobox-highlights"></section><h3 class="about-the-show">About the show</h3><article><section class="content-block type-html"><div class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, guest host George Knapp welcomed <a href="https://youtube.com/@area52investigations" target="_blank">Chris Ramsay</a>, a professional magician and creator of the YouTube channel Area 52, to share his journey exploring paranormal phenomena, particularly remote viewing and out-of-body experiences. &quot;I think keeping an open mind is the most important part when doing all this,&quot; he noted, &quot;because confirmation bias gets in the way both if you're a skeptic or if you're a believer.&quot;</p>

<p>Ramsay described remote viewing as a practice where individuals gather information about a distant or unseen target, often leading to surprising accuracy. He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.</p>

<p>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.</p>

<p>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.</p>

<p>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>In the second half, <a href="https://www.sifuericoram.com/" target="_blank">Eric Oram</a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.</p>

<p>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.</p>

<p>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.</p>

<p>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.</p>

the first half, guest host George Knapp welcomed \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/@area52investigations\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Ramsay\u003c/a>, a professional magician and creator of the YouTube channel Area 52, to share his journey exploring paranormal phenomena, particularly remote viewing and out-of-body experiences. &quot;I think keeping an open mind is the most important part when doing all this,&quot; he noted, &quot;because confirmation bias gets in the way both if you're a skeptic or if you're a believer.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ramsay described remote viewing as a practice where individuals gather information about a distant or unseen target, often leading to surprising accuracy. He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while

He asserted that vast, secret facilities have been built beneath the Earth's surface—some for military use, others possibly for sheltering elite figures in the event of catastrophic global events. These underground cities and tunnel networks are said to span miles and extend thousands of feet underground, supported by advanced engineering and funded largely through public taxes and covert budgets. According to Sauder, these facilities are complex, multi-level cities outfitted with sophisticated technology and infrastructure.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder explained that much of this underground construction is carried out through Special Access Programs, highly classified government and military operations shielded from oversight and scrutiny. These programs, he claimed, are tied to organizations such as the U.S. Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, and corporations like Bechtel, Kiewit, Parsons, and Black &amp; Veatch. He pointed to the Deep Underground Control Center beneath Washington, D.C., a project decades in the making, with elevators connecting to government sites such as the White House, Pentagon, and Naval Observatory. Documents Sauder uncovered suggest these facilities reach depths of up to 3,500 feet and have been under development since at least the early Cold War era.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Beyond Washington, Sauder highlighted specific underground bases such as the one hidden in New Mexico's Manzano Mountains. Based on insider accounts, he described it not as vast, sprawling for miles beneath the surface and possibly still expanding. He suggested similar facilities exist beneath mountains, deserts, and even under the sea, such as one reportedly built by Parsons in the Gulf of Mexico. Sauder believes these installations are often connected by high-speed underground transit systems and may involve collaboration with extraterrestrial or non-human entities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder contended that these underground facilities are hidden because they are not intended for public benefit. Instead, they serve a select class of government and corporate elites who have effectively walled themselves off from the consequences of global instability. Entry into this world, he warned, requires full submission to the program—loss of personal freedom, secrecy for life, and potentially no way out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder also shared the personal journey that led him to relocate to South America after a transformative shamanic vision quest. Through the use of Ayahuasca under the guidance of indigenous shamans, he experienced profound revelations that convinced him never to return to the U.S. Through his visionary experiences, particularly during a significant Ayahuasca ceremony in 2012, Sauder claimed to have received telepathic insights about a dystopian future. He described being shown a highly detailed vision of a totalitarian prison planet—complete with military control, surveillance infrastructure, and spiritual subjugation. \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Hidden-Plain-Sight-Beyond-X-Files/dp/1948803348/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UNDERGROUND-BASES-TUNNELS-Government-Trying/dp/1939149266/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Underground Bases &amp; Tunnels\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Underwater-Underground-Bases-Surprising-Government/dp/1939149282/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Underwater &amp; Underground Bases\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Jamiroquai","title":"Deeper Underground","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001386W46/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001386W46"},{"artist":"Best Coast","title":"California Nights","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TK8TSZG/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Big Country","title":"Peace In Our Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073J39RFC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Gerry Rafferty","title":"Get It Right Next Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B013HD4DTU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B013HD4DTU"},{"artist":"Dream Theater","title":"Take Away My Pain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AKBPK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AKBPK"},{"artist":"Boston","title":"Hitch A Ride","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00N5VKPH4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00N5VKPH4"},{"artist":"Echo And The Bunnymen","title":"The Killing Moon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012287IW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012287IW"},{"artist":"The Fixx","title":"Stand Or Fall","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004IDYQ8W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004IDYQ8W"},{"artist":"Incubus","title":"Drive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GALM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GALM"},{"artist":"Godsmack","title":"Voodoo","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003IYRBRU/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The 1975","title":"Oh Caroline","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DTVZHFLH/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DTVZHFLH"},{"artist":"Everly Brothers","title":"All I Have To Do Is Dream","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00I0HNCV4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00I0HNCV4"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Love Is A Battlefield","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD777C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD777C"},{"artist":"Stereo MC's","title":"Connected","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1VUB0/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfff069537fd678a3ece5d5"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/underground facilities"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/68286c2ee116e9c3432ca240","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 16 2025 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, guest host George Knapp welcomed \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/@area52investigations\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Ramsay\u003c/a>, a professional magician and creator of the YouTube channel Area 52, to share his journey exploring paranormal phenomena, particularly remote viewing and out-of-body experiences. &quot;I think keeping an open mind is the most important part when doing all this,&quot; he noted, &quot;because confirmation bias gets in the way both if you're a skeptic or if you're a believer.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ramsay described remote viewing as a practice where individuals gather information about a distant or unseen target, often leading to surprising accuracy. He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

the first half, guest host George Knapp welcomed \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/@area52investigations\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Ramsay\u003c/a>, a professional magician and creator of the YouTube channel Area 52, to share his journey exploring paranormal phenomena, particularly remote viewing and out-of-body experiences. &quot;I think keeping an open mind is the most important part when doing all this,&quot; he noted, &quot;because confirmation bias gets in the way both if you're a skeptic or if you're a believer.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ramsay described remote viewing as a practice where individuals gather information about a distant or unseen target, often leading to surprising accuracy. He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

the first half, guest host George Knapp welcomed \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/@area52investigations\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Ramsay\u003c/a>, a professional magician and creator of the YouTube channel Area 52, to share his journey exploring paranormal phenomena, particularly remote viewing and out-of-body experiences. &quot;I think keeping an open mind is the most important part when doing all this,&quot; he noted, &quot;because confirmation bias gets in the way both if you're a skeptic or if you're a believer.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ramsay described remote viewing as a practice where individuals gather information about a distant or unseen target, often leading to surprising accuracy. He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

He discovered this technique through his friend Nelson Dallas, a memory champion who was part of a hedge fund's experiments to use remote viewing to perform better in stock trading.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This piqued Ramsay's curiosity, leading him to study the field himself over the course of a year. His explorations brought him in contact with notable figures in the remote viewing community, including Joe McMoneagle, known for his high-profile missions, including the successful viewing of kidnapped General Dozier.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then turned to the topic of out-of-body experiences, or OBEs. Ramsay vividly recounted a friend's OBE where they explored the Great Pyramid of Giza, discovering things that closely aligned with recent scientific revelations about the ancient structure. In reflecting on his own experiences, Ramsay described how they shifted his perceptions around spirituality and life after death. &quot;When I saw my physical self laying there with my eyes closed, it was a dramatic and terrifying experience, but also a very soothing sort of knowing,&quot; he reflected.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on UFO disclosure, with Ramsay expressing fascination while encouraging a cautious approach. &quot;I try not to let myself get too carried away with the movement towards disclosure,&quot; he said, underscoring the importance of personal exploration rather than relying solely on the government to tell the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.sifuericoram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Oram\u003c/a>, a Wing Chun Kung Fu master, spoke about this form of martial arts and the profound internal transformations that occur through rigorous training.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Oram's journey began in response to being bullied in school. He found inspiration in Bruce Lee's iconic film Enter the Dragon, saying, &quot;I watched [the movie] and it blew my mind that this little Chinese guy could just move like that.&quot; This fascination led him to Wing Chun, a style known for its efficiency and practicality, allowing for simultaneous offense and defense.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A foundational aspect of Wing Chun is utilizing minimal movement for maximum effectiveness. &quot;It was originally designed and engineered for warfare to create the least amount of movement for the maximum amount of power,&quot; Oram explained. This efficiency enables smaller individuals to overcome larger opponents through precise techniques.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on his early training, Oram remarked, &quot;I learned more about the principles of fighting in the first 30 minutes with [my teacher] than I had in the four years previous.&quot; Throughout his career, he has trained numerous actors, including Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr., who wanted to bring authenticity to their roles. He shared experiences from his time on set, where his advice significantly influenced fight choreography in films like Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Oram, &quot;Warriors are not built in the comfort zone.&quot; He stressed that personal growth often arises from challenging experiences, a sentiment deeply rooted in his training philosophy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This latter part of the program also focused on UFOs, with Oram describing a shared encounter with his children. &quot;[The object] was shimmering… and then it turned into a pinpoint of light,&quot; he recalled, while also revealing that his parents had similar encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared

He asserted that vast, secret facilities have been built beneath the Earth's surface—some for military use, others possibly for sheltering elite figures in the event of catastrophic global events. These underground cities and tunnel networks are said to span miles and extend thousands of feet underground, supported by advanced engineering and funded largely through public taxes and covert budgets. According to Sauder, these facilities are complex, multi-level cities outfitted with sophisticated technology and infrastructure.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder explained that much of this underground construction is carried out through Special Access Programs, highly classified government and military operations shielded from oversight and scrutiny. These programs, he claimed, are tied to organizations such as the U.S. Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, and corporations like Bechtel, Kiewit, Parsons, and Black &amp; Veatch. He pointed to the Deep Underground Control Center beneath Washington, D.C., a project decades in the making, with elevators connecting to government sites such as the White House, Pentagon, and Naval Observatory. Documents Sauder uncovered suggest these facilities reach depths of up to 3,500 feet and have been under development since at least the early Cold War era.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Beyond Washington, Sauder highlighted specific underground bases such as the one hidden in New Mexico's Manzano Mountains. Based on insider accounts, he described it not as vast, sprawling for miles beneath the surface and possibly still expanding. He suggested similar facilities exist beneath mountains, deserts, and even under the sea, such as one reportedly built by Parsons in the Gulf of Mexico. Sauder believes these installations are often connected by high-speed underground transit systems and may involve collaboration with extraterrestrial or non-human entities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder contended that these underground facilities are hidden because they are not intended for public benefit. Instead, they serve a select class of government and corporate elites who have effectively walled themselves off from the consequences of global instability. Entry into this world, he warned, requires full submission to the program—loss of personal freedom, secrecy for life, and potentially no way out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder also shared the personal journey that led him to relocate to South America after a transformative shamanic vision quest. Through the use of Ayahuasca under the guidance of indigenous shamans, he experienced profound revelations that convinced him never to return to the U.S. Through his visionary experiences, particularly during a significant Ayahuasca ceremony in 2012, Sauder claimed to have received telepathic insights about a dystopian future. He described being shown a highly detailed vision of a totalitarian prison planet—complete with military control, surveillance infrastructure, and spiritual subjugation. \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Hidden-Plain-Sight-Beyond-X-Files/dp/1948803348/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UNDERGROUND-BASES-TUNNELS-Government-Trying/dp/1939149266/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Underground Bases &amp; Tunnels\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Underwater-Underground-Bases-Surprising-Government/dp/1939149282/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Underwater &amp; Underground Bases\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Jamiroquai","title":"Deeper Underground","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001386W46/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001386W46"},{"artist":"Best Coast","title":"California Nights","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TK8TSZG/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Big Country","title":"Peace In Our Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073J39RFC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Gerry Rafferty","title":"Get It Right Next Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B013HD4DTU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B013HD4DTU"},{"artist":"Dream Theater","title":"Take Away My Pain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AKBPK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AKBPK"},{"artist":"Boston","title":"Hitch A Ride","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00N5VKPH4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00N5VKPH4"},{"artist":"Echo And The Bunnymen","title":"The Killing Moon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012287IW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012287IW"},{"artist":"The Fixx","title":"Stand Or Fall","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004IDYQ8W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004IDYQ8W"},{"artist":"Incubus","title":"Drive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GALM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GALM"},{"artist":"Godsmack","title":"Voodoo","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003IYRBRU/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The 1975","title":"Oh Caroline","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DTVZHFLH/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DTVZHFLH"},{"artist":"Everly Brothers","title":"All I Have To Do Is Dream","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00I0HNCV4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00I0HNCV4"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Love Is A Battlefield","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD777C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD777C"},{"artist":"Stereo MC's","title":"Connected","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1VUB0/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfff069537fd678a3ece5d5"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/underground facilities"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/68286c2ee116e9c3432ca240","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 16 2025 -

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

href=\"https://richardsauder.substack.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Richard Sauder\u003c/u>\u003c/a>, a political scientist and long-time researcher, joined guest host Rich Berra (\u003ca href=\"mailto:richberra@coasttocoastam.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>email\u003c/u>\u003c/a>) for the entire 4-hour program to share his decades of research investigating the existence and construction of underground and underwater bases. He asserted that vast, secret facilities have been built beneath the Earth's surface—some for military use, others possibly for sheltering elite figures in the event of catastrophic global events. These underground cities and tunnel networks are said to span miles and extend thousands of feet underground, supported by advanced engineering and funded largely through public taxes and covert budgets. According to Sauder, these facilities are complex, multi-level cities outfitted with sophisticated technology and infrastructure.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder explained that much of this underground construction is carried out through Special Access Programs, highly classified government and military operations shielded from oversight and scrutiny. These programs, he claimed, are tied to organizations such as the U.S. Navy, Army Corps of Engineers, and corporations like Bechtel, Kiewit, Parsons, and Black &amp; Veatch. He pointed to the Deep Underground Control Center beneath Washington, D.C., a project decades in the making, with elevators connecting to government sites such as the White House, Pentagon, and Naval Observatory. Documents Sauder uncovered suggest these facilities reach depths of up to 3,500 feet and have been under development since at least the early Cold War era.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Beyond Washington, Sauder highlighted specific underground bases such as the one hidden in New Mexico's Manzano Mountains. Based on insider accounts, he described it not as vast, sprawling for miles beneath the surface and possibly still expanding. He suggested similar facilities exist beneath mountains, deserts, and even under the sea, such as one reportedly built by Parsons in the Gulf of Mexico. Sauder believes these installations are often connected by high-speed underground transit systems and may involve collaboration with extraterrestrial or non-human entities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder contended that these underground facilities are hidden because they are not intended for public benefit. Instead, they serve a select class of government and corporate elites who have effectively walled themselves off from the consequences of global instability. Entry into this world, he warned, requires full submission to the program—loss of personal freedom, secrecy for life, and potentially no way out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sauder also shared the personal journey that led him to relocate to South America after a transformative shamanic vision quest. Through the use of Ayahuasca under the guidance of indigenous shamans, he experienced profound revelations that convinced him never to return to the U.S. Through his visionary experiences, particularly during a significant Ayahuasca ceremony in 2012, Sauder claimed to have received telepathic insights about a dystopian future. He described being shown a highly detailed vision of a totalitarian prison planet—complete with military control, surveillance infrastructure, and spiritual subjugation. \u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Hidden-Plain-Sight-Beyond-X-Files/dp/1948803348/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Hidden in Plain Sight: Beyond the X-Files\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UNDERGROUND-BASES-TUNNELS-Government-Trying/dp/1939149266/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Underground Bases &amp; Tunnels\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Underwater-Underground-Bases-Surprising-Government/dp/1939149282/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Underwater &amp; Underground Bases\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Jamiroquai","title":"Deeper Underground","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001386W46/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001386W46"},{"artist":"Best Coast","title":"California Nights","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TK8TSZG/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Big Country","title":"Peace In Our Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073J39RFC/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Gerry Rafferty","title":"Get It Right Next Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B013HD4DTU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B013HD4DTU"},{"artist":"Dream Theater","title":"Take Away My Pain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AKBPK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AKBPK"},{"artist":"Boston","title":"Hitch A Ride","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00N5VKPH4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00N5VKPH4"},{"artist":"Echo And The Bunnymen","title":"The Killing Moon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012287IW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012287IW"},{"artist":"The Fixx","title":"Stand Or Fall","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004IDYQ8W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004IDYQ8W"},{"artist":"Incubus","title":"Drive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GALM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GALM"},{"artist":"Godsmack","title":"Voodoo","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003IYRBRU/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The 1975","title":"Oh Caroline","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DTVZHFLH/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DTVZHFLH"},{"artist":"Everly Brothers","title":"All I Have To Do Is Dream","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00I0HNCV4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00I0HNCV4"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Love Is A Battlefield","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD777C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD777C"},{"artist":"Stereo MC's","title":"Connected","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1VUB0/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfff069537fd678a3ece5d5"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/underground facilities"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/68286c2ee116e9c3432ca240","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 16 2025 -

Landman argued that such practices have been covertly going on since at least the late 1800s, referencing a 1891 US government patent for producing rainfall. &quot;People started to notice it about 30 years ago... when the 'grid patterns' [of chemtrails] in the sky started to pick up,&quot; he remarked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Landman claimed NASA has a daily budget of $80 million for its chemtrail program. &quot;There's a lot of nefarious action going on... it's all covert,&quot; he stated, adding that international participation includes organizations like the United Nations and companies like General Electric. He also highlighted the UK's recent announcement to invest in geoengineering, and the recent reports of that country's attempts to dim the sun.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Landman stressed these technologies are toxic, with many methods using heavy metals such as aluminum and barium. He suggested the grand agenda here is to create problems that only the authorities can solve. &quot;They're creating catastrophes so that they can come in and be the heroes with the solution,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Despite his concerns, Landman remains optimistic about the potential for change, stating, &quot;We are winning this war... there is a rising consciousness.&quot; He likens the current situation around chemtrails to the earlier battles against GMOs, suggesting that public awareness can promote societal change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half of the program welcomed \u003ca href=\"http://360prosperity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maria Martinez\u003c/a>, a multi-dimensional healer and shaman with a rich lineage who has been navigating various dimensions and timelines since childhood. Guided by a team of angels and other luminous beings, Martinez's early experiences with the supernatural shaped her mission to help individuals achieve what she describes as &quot;divine sovereignty.&quot; She explained, &quot;Now I work as an architect of the divine template… helping [others] come back to the supernatural beings that they are.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Describing her own identity as a Starseed, Martinez noted her connections to other dimensions and alien races such as the Pleiadians and Arcturians. She referred to the Pleiadians as &quot;gentle healers&quot; and the Arcturians as &quot;architects,&quot; summarizing their unique roles in propelling humanity's evolution. Her role is to clear interferences that prevent individuals from accessing their true potential and contribute meaningfully to the world.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Martinez elaborated on her approach to healing, which involves accessing a person's multi-dimensional bodies to identify blockages. &quot;I can hear their thoughts, unconscious thoughts… I can see the way their field is running,&quot; she explained. Her focus is on personal empowerment, with the goal to &quot;restore [one's] true sovereignty and align back to the authenticity of who they are.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Speaking of a broader cosmic mission, Martinez mentioned her collaborations with star councils—groups of benevolent beings from different galaxies that support human ascension and wellness. &quot;They're kind of your board of directors,&quot; she said, indicating their role in guiding individuals toward their divine purpose.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Throughout the interview, she emphasized the importance of personal responsibility in the healing journey, encouraging individuals to understand and embrace their gifts. As for humanity's future, Martinez expressed hope, stating, &quot;When we live in possibility, everything is possible.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final hour of the program featured Martinez giving readings to callers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://natureoflongevity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Douglas Mulhall\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Gerard Way","title":"How It's Going to Be","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00MOGYS10/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00MOGYS10"},{"artist":"The Association","title":"Cherish","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001OGRK9I/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001OGRK9I"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"Night Ranger","title":"Sister Christian","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NTYN00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NTYN00"},{"artist":"Queens Of The Stone Age","title":"The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZKNLU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZKNLU"},{"artist":"Bye-Bye Birdy Cast","title":"Kids","url":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6BpecNMrX7WMJCFscf5OOG"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Rain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BCQDL8XW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BCQDL8XW"},{"artist":"Procol Harum","title":"A Whiter Shade Of Pale","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BZX2L8C8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BZX2L8C8"},{"artist":"Harry Nilsson","title":"Me and My Arrow","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B072ML5Z1Z/ctoc/?trackAsin=B072ML5Z1Z"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"All Or Nothing At All","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138EOTQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00138EOTQ"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Seychelles","url":"https://open.spotify.com/track/29KN56j0zRMe3yi3gdONVr"},{"artist":"Joe Walsh","title":"Happy Ways","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07G9391DN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07G9391DN"},{"artist":"Nirvana","title":"Oh Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VWKVXI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VWKVXI"},{"artist":"Sarah Vaughan","title":"All The Things You Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CZ7MV865/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CZ7MV865"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e0076b1537fd678a3eceba5","%2F681d45c339bb5af930c201f2"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/geoengineering","keywords/chemtrails","keywords/Starseeds","keywords/Pleiadians"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/682714443e8a368e515a0d04","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 15 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/682714523e8a368e515a0d05","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 15 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/682714613e8a368e515a0d06","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 15 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/682714723e8a368e515a0d07","show":"coast","title":"Thu, May 15 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Alien, android, humanoid cyborg watching a holographic blue Earth planet floating over his hand.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Royal coffins were sometimes reused during times of economic collapse, particularly during the Bronze Age, and the high priesthood of Amun repurposed treasures from royal tombs during crises, she reported. &quot;People in a time of crisis are very scrappy and creative about how to get wealth from the ancestors,&quot; she remarked. Addressing the ongoing search for Cleopatra's tomb, she suggested that it's likely underneath the Mediterranean Sea.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the mysteries of the pyramids, she mentioned recent muon imaging studies that suggest there are undiscovered chambers within the Great Pyramid, which she believes was created to elevate humans to divine status. Cooney proposed that the pyramids were built using advanced hydraulic techniques, arguing, &quot;Nothing moves stone faster than floating it... you're going to be lifting them into place using as much water as you possibly can.&quot; She also entertained the idea of an internal ramp system, dismissing traditional external ramps as impractical.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Shifting to the subject of female power, Cooney highlighted the rarity of women attaining kingship in ancient societies, noting that Egypt &quot;allowed women to transcend the normal patriarchal structures... five of whom became nothing less than King.&quot; She emphasized the significance of lineage in Egyptian culture, explaining that maintaining a royal bloodline was crucial for political stability, yet often led to issues of civil strife due to too many heirs.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, ufologist and retired Army Lieutenant Colonel \u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Kevin Randle\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed time travel, both real-world possibilities and science fiction. His new novel, &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Second-Tuesday-Next-Week/dp/B0DTXFS3YN/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">On the Second Tuesday of Next Week\u003c/a>,&quot; unfolds after a battle against an alien race, where human soldiers realize the outcome has been altered by time travel. &quot;Our side has to figure out how to time travel...to put it back the way it's supposed to be,&quot; he explained, pointing to the complexities and potential chaos associated with manipulating time. The conversation touched on the philosophical implications of time travel, including the infamous grandfather paradox. Randle posited, &quot;Even though you've traveled back in time and somehow killed your grandfather, you would still have to exist because you're the instrument of the change.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He explored the concept of time dilation, where time slows down for those traveling near the speed of light, leading to significant differences in time experienced by travelers versus those on Earth. &quot;A trip that maybe takes you four years to get to the nearest star system, maybe 150-200 years have passed on Earth,&quot; Randle pointed out. This phenomenon raises intriguing questions about the potential consequences of time travel, including the possibility of creating alternate timelines. When asked about the potential for mental time travel, he mentioned the idea of astral projection, and cited how some remote viewers claim to have viewed past events. He also speculated on the existence of time travelers among us, and the theory that UFO visitors are actually time travelers from our future.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307956776/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Woman Who Would Be King\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/142622088X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">When Women Ruled the World: Six Queens of Egypt\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Recycling-Death-Nineteenth-Twenty-second-Dynasties/dp/1649031289/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Recycling for Death: Coffin Reuse in Ancient Egypt and the Theban Royal Caches\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Second-Tuesday-Next-Week/dp/B0DTXFS3YN/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">On the Second Tuesday of Next Week\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UFOs-Deep-State-Military-Governments/dp/1632651904/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">UFOs and the Deep State\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UNDERSTANDING-ROSWELL-TRUE-STORY-HAPPENED/dp/B09TNGGX38/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding Roswell\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"},{"artist":"Lou Reed ","title":"Satellite of Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00UPGNJMU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00UPGNJMU"},{"artist":"The Vogues","title":"You're The One","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CJFFB9SY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CJFFB9SY"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness (Part 1)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"All Over The World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136JRCW/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Crystal Castles","title":"Empathy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BT571YPB/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BT571YPB"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"That's Life","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TU1BWTS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00TU1BWTS"},{"artist":"The Prodigy","title":"3 Kilos","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00759FKGS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00759FKGS"},{"artist":"The Turtles","title":"Elenore","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0025W53RG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0025W53RG"},{"artist":"Dot Hacker","title":"Order/Disorder","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BY3GQX36/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BY3GQX36"},{"artist":"Andy Williams","title":"Stranger On The Shore","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01EEN5PHQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01EEN5PHQ"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Saturn","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01INYFNE2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01INYFNE2"},{"artist":"Radiohead ","title":"Subterranean Homesick Alien","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01DPRQ7B0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01DPRQ7B0"},{"artist":"The Modern Lovers","title":" Roadrunner","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000RGCPXW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000RGCPXW"},{"artist":"Tony Bennett","title":"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00F878T3A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00F878T3A"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":" Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F619d9ec1bcb8edbe33de4774","%2F5dffde60537fd678a3ece4e3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/ancient Egypt","keywords/time travel"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6825c65fb68ef98ac5046d6d","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 14 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6825c69eb68ef98ac5046d6e","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 14 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6825c6c4b68ef98ac5046d6f","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 14 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6825c6ecb68ef98ac5046d70","show":"coast","title":"Wed, May 14 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Explores ancient temples in Egypt.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He emphasized its importance as &quot;our master regulatory system&quot; that interacts with various subsystems, including the immune and nervous systems. Addressing common misconceptions, he lamented the bias in professional circles that often equates cannabinoids with cannabis, despite the ECS being present in most life forms. He explained, &quot;This system is really driven and fed by dietary fats,&quot; specifically Omega-3 and Omega-6, which are vital for maintaining health.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He stressed the importance of balancing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in our diets as an imbalance between them can lead to heightened reactivity and inflammation, making individuals more susceptible to infections. He described omega-6 fats as inflammatory, while omega-3 fats are cooling and help mitigate inflammation. Chia seeds are a good source of omega-3, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also advocated for intermittent fasting, stating, &quot;Every time we eat, we go into low gear for five hours,&quot; which can hinder our immune response. Paul founded TrueMedX, a supplement company based on his patent that manipulates the endocannabinoid system with non-cannabis plants.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and experiencer \u003ca href=\"https://ufoofgod.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Bledsoe\u003c/a> recounted his life-altering encounter in 2007 while on a fishing trip. He was at a low point in his life and called out for help in the form of a prayer, and shortly after, two glowing orbs appeared in the sky. His interaction with the orbs wasn't a dream, as it happened in broad daylight, he emphasized. The orbs communicated with him telepathically, and after an episode of missing time, he returned healed from Crohn's disease, a condition that had plagued him for years.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>However, his newfound reality was met with skepticism from his community in North Carolina, who accused him of &quot;playing with the devil.&quot; Despite the backlash, his story gained traction, leading to interest from high-level scientists and government officials. &quot;Congress has been briefed on it... they've seen my videos,&quot; he reported. Bledsoe has continued to have unusual visitations since the 2007 episode, including a significant encounter with a figure he believes to be the Blessed Virgin, who conveyed a message about future global events. &quot;She told me there would be a time when you see Israel and Iran exchanging weapons... and then the orbs would reveal themselves.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Bledsoe also discussed his journey from skepticism to understanding, explaining that he felt compelled to write his book only after the government began to openly acknowledge UFOs in recent years. His ongoing experiences include public sky watches, where he has witnessed orbs with hundreds of attendees, including scientists.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

She emphasized that validation is distinct from approval or praise, and that one can validate another's feelings without necessarily agreeing with their views. &quot;Praise is a judgment... Validation says I accept you independent of how you look or perform,&quot; she noted. &quot;Validation,&quot; she continued, &quot;communicates that one is mindful, they understand, and they empathize with some part of another person's experience.&quot; This process involves making another person feel seen and accepted, which is crucial for fostering personal growth and resolving conflicts.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dr. Fleck elaborated on the dual nature of validation, explaining that it can be both given by others and practiced as self-validation. When you effectively help another person feel seen and heard, &quot;they're actually much more receptive to working toward personal growth,&quot; she noted. This skill is vital in therapy, where professionals must balance acceptance with the need for change. In the workplace, she described validation as an overlooked positive reinforcement, emphasizing that acknowledging employees as individuals fosters a deeper connection.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Further, she explained that dismissing a child's feelings can lead to significant mental health issues, stating, &quot;When you invalidate a child's emotions... you're basically dismissing that kid's experience.&quot; Fleck stressed recognizing children's emotions to foster healthy self-esteem and emotional intelligence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, writer and researcher \u003ca href=\"https://goddart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Michael Goddart\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared insights from his spiritual journey and exploration of past lives. Starting meditation at age 19 and intensifying it to two and a half hours daily by 21, he has traveled to over 50 countries in search of truth and enlightenment. &quot;My spiritual evolution started thousands of lives ago,&quot; he remarked, emphasizing his belief in reincarnation and the soul's progression through various lifetimes. He elaborated on his experiences across 88 past lives (\u003ca href=\"https://www.goddart.com/download/list-of-recovered-past-lives-of-michael-goddart-with-color-coded-groupings.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">view list\u003c/a>), including one 12 lives back, when he was a high-level government official in Tibet and had a lot of contact with a group of 210 Buddhist monks. It was at this time that he realized some of them were not ordinary humans, and &quot;their consciousness seemed to reach high up into heaven. So that was the first life...that my higher mind was predominant over my lower mind,&quot; he recounted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In his memoir, he also includes &quot;12 lives where my negative actions outweighed the positive ones, and I had to reincarnate as an animal,&quot; as a form of karmic balance. Touching on the nature of déjà vu experiences, he suggested that these fleeting feelings of familiarity may be linked to past lives, and can function as entry points for recall. Goddart delved into the concept of the soul, describing it as our &quot;true self&quot; that exists in a state of bliss before being drawn into the physical world. He also touched on the journey of spiritual evolution, and how the desire to return to the source of God can lead individuals to enlightenment. His latest book, &quot;The Contentment Dividend,&quot; serves as a guide to eliminating suffering and reconnecting with one's higher self.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mikebara.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mike Bara\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Validation-Revolutionized-Psychology-Transform-Relationships/dp/0593541219/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Validation\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Contentment-Dividend-Meditations-Realizing-Your/dp/1960090429/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Contentment Dividend\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Search-Lost-Lives-Sanskaras-Evolution/dp/1944037837//ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">In Search of Lost Lives: Desire, Sanskaras, and the Evolution of a Mind &amp;

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Kennedy, Jr.'s death. He asserted that it's impossible the fatal plane crash was an accident.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jeffries provided a critical timeline of events on that fateful day in July of 1999. &quot;JFK Jr. was supposed to fly to Martha's Vineyard for the wedding of one of his cousins,&quot; he stated. &quot;They left the New Jersey airport, and from that point, we don't know what happened.&quot; He focused on a 9:39 PM phone call made by JFK Jr. that received minimal attention from mainstream media.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to the official timeline, the aircraft disappeared from radar shortly after this phone call, but search efforts were notably delayed. &quot;The only thing that got them moving at all was when Ted Kennedy himself called President Clinton,&quot; Jeffries remarked. &quot;They appeared to be looking in the wrong areas.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reports initially described that night as having clear skies, not hazardous flying conditions as was later claimed. In addition, Jeffries mentioned accounts of an explosion around the time of the crash, hinting at the possibility of foul play. He referenced a lawyer and an unnamed reporter from the Martha's Vineyard Gazette who both claimed to have witnessed an explosion prior to the crash. &quot;There was such secrecy surrounding what happened,&quot; he noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jeffries explained how JFK Jr. &quot;had an obsessive quest to find out who killed his father,&quot; and that &quot;his desire to get into politics was propelled primarily by his interest in exposing the truth about his [father's] assassination.&quot; His research posits that JFK Jr.'s potential run for the Senate may have posed a threat to various powerful interests. He also expressed concern over the rapid cremation of the bodies and the lack of a thorough autopsy, noting how no comprehensive findings were released.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, rebel engineer \u003ca href=\"http://www.putschracing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Casey Putsch\u003c/a> discussed his groundbreaking Omega Car, which challenges conventional automotive limits. With an astounding claim of achieving over 100 miles per gallon, Putsch's creation is a prototype that draws on his years of passion and experience in design and engineering.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He described the Omega Car as having a sleek, aerodynamic design that incorporates features to reduce drag effectively, including covered wheels and butterfly doors that open upwards.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the nature of current automotive technologies, Putsch stated, &quot;The entirety of the industrialized world over the last 150 years is built on steel and powered by oil.&quot; He posits that the industry is entrenched in outdated practices and regulations that stifle innovation, saying, &quot;Our automotive industry stinks.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Putsch believes diesel is a superior fuel choice compared to electric options, especially regarding energy density. He noted that his car could achieve a lower carbon footprint than current electric vehicles when considering the environmental toll of generating electricity. He also expressed frustration with the media's coverage of automobiles, claiming it has ignored his achievements while prioritizing control over innovation.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Putsch shared his aspiration to create various vehicles, including a family-sized car, as well as light- and heavy-duty trucks.

Forbes suggested the plane experienced a lithium-ion battery fire, which would have caused incapacitating smoke while allowing the aircraft to continue flying for over an hour. He emphasized that Malaysian officials lied about radar data, and theorized the fire may have served as cover for a more sophisticated operation targeting key passengers—namely 20 employees from Freescale Semiconductor with ties to U.S. defense technology—who may have been defecting or carrying sensitive knowledge.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He pointed to videos from 2014 that purportedly show MH370 surrounded by three plasma orbs that ultimately &quot;teleport&quot; the plane. According to Forbes, these videos are genuine military surveillance footage, not CGI, and the orbs represent advanced U.S.-developed autonomous drone weapons, not extraterrestrial craft. He identified the source of the videos as a Navy officer allegedly punished under suspicious national security charges. Forbes argued that this incident exposed the existence of a secret U.S. breakaway technological civilization decades ahead of public science, operating with quantum-level weapons capable of teleportation and possibly tied to zero-point energy or cold fusion. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Forbes said the U.S. government not only possesses this secret technology but actively suppresses and manipulates public perception through media and staged disclosure efforts. Officials like Obama, Clapper, and Haines were directly involved in managing the MH370 cover-up, evidenced by delayed responses and heavy intelligence involvement, he continued. Forbes suggested the military-industrial complex uses public UFO interest to mask real technological breakthroughs. This incident could be the key to understanding the true nature of the UAP phenomenon—not alien visitation, but clandestine human-developed tech far beyond what is publicly acknowledged, he noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half of the program, \u003ca href=\"https://robertktanenbaumbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Robert K. Tanenbaum\u003c/u>\u003c/a>, a former homicide prosecutor and Deputy Chief Counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, discussed his firsthand experience investigating the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Initially skeptical and uninvolved in conspiracy theories, Tanenbaum’s views shifted after encountering evidence and serious obstruction from the CIA. He emphasized that his investigation, initiated by Chief Counsel Richard Sprague, was only undertaken after assurances from Congress that it would be free from political interference. However, within four months, those assurances unraveled, and Tanenbaum and Sprague concluded that their findings were being actively suppressed. According to Tanenbaum, the CIA not only obstructed the investigation but may have participated in the assassination.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Tanenbaum pointed to the eyewitness testimony from Dealey Plaza and the scientific evidence in the Zapruder film to refute the official narrative of a lone gunman. He cited the sequence and timing of the gunshots, especially the two flurries of fire within 8.3 seconds, as being inconsistent with the mechanical limitations of Oswald's alleged rifle. He highlighted the physical reactions of JFK's body—specifically the backward and then forward motion of his head—as incompatible with the government's theory that all shots came from behind. Tanenbaum noted the absurdity of the CIA's efforts to replicate the headshot scenario using gelatinized skulls—all of which responded in a way that contradicted the official account.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Tanenbaum condemned using neutron activation analysis (NAA), once used by the FBI to validate bullet fragment matching, as discredited science. He recounted that after metallurgical experts denounced NAA's reliability, the U.S. government shut down its only lab conducting those tests in 2005. Yet, the flawed science had already been used to uphold the single-bullet theory and the case against Oswald. Tanenbaum alleged that the CIA, threatened by Kennedy’s intention to restructure intelligence operations under his brother Robert, chose to eliminate the president rather than relinquish power. In his view, the Kennedy assassination was not just a murder, but an institutional betrayal covered by decades of deception and flawed forensics.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/That-Day-Dallas-Harvey-Oswald/dp/1510783652/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>That Day in Dallas\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Red Rider","title":"Lunatic Fringe","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000ULCSAY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000ULCSAY"},{"artist":"Dream Theater","title":"Hollow Years","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018ANZ1C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018ANZ1C"},{"artist":"The Highwayman","title":"Highwayman","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136S1F6/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Ambrosia","title":"Holdin' On To Yesterday","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001OGPTTQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001OGPTTQ"},{"artist":"Billie Eilish","title":"Everything I Wanted","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B081BCLTVJ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B081BCLTVJ"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Veteran of the Psychic Wars","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137T0AU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137T0AU"},{"artist":"Bob Marley","title":"Waiting In Vain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FPW3T69/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FPW3T69"},{"artist":"Coldplay","title":"In My Place","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KHEHH32/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00KHEHH32"},{"artist":"The Cure","title":"Close To Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001AXMEV4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001AXMEV4"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"The Man Who Sold The World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2KEMI/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Elton John","title":"Burn Down The Mission","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00GOMFF3K/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Nik Kershaw","title":"Wouldn't It Be Good","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0B815ZH4Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0B815ZH4Q"},{"artist":"Real Life","title":"Send Me An Angel","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013KYZXY/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F655e76430683f0e1f6c3de4c","%2F681d3b23a25dfa88f7111ecc"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Flight MH370","keywords/JFK assassination"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/682084142c572cb8e2fd6a0c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 10 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/682084242c572cb8e2fd6a0d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 10 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6820843b2c572cb8e2fd6a0e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 10 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6820844d2c572cb8e2fd6a0f","show":"coast","title":"Sat, May 10 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A flight of UFOs over the giant glaciers on the slopes of Mount Rainier, in Mount Rainier National Park, Washington.

This nitric oxide supplement he says supports immune and heart health. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hewlett recounted a powerful personal story of transformation, shifting from a career in financial services to health advocacy following a life-threatening medical experience. With a family history of heart disease and his near-death hospitalization due to surgical errors, he rejected the prospect of a quadruple bypass and sought natural alternatives. This led to his discovery of nitric oxide's health benefits, which he credits for reversing his cardiovascular issues and extending his life. Out of this journey came the creation of the supplement Cardio Miracle, which he described as a natural science-backed solution to reclaim personal health.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hewlett emphasized Cardio Miracle's scientific credibility, highlighting international studies, endorsements from notable health experts, and a focus on nitric oxide and vitamin D3. He claimed the supplement can reduce or replace many prescriptions and described its effects as nearly miraculous for conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and chronic inflammation. Hewlett aligned the product with broader health movements and voiced distrust in the conventional medical system, positioning Cardio Miracle as a wellness solution and a form of health independence. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hewlett offered Coast listeners a special Cardio Miracle Starter Kit at half price at \u003ca href=\"https://cardiomiracle.com/coast\" target=\"_blank\">cardiomiracle.com/coast\u003c/a>. Additionally, he provided a 10% discount on all purchases made until the end of the month when using the code COAST at checkout.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Diane, a clairvoyant from New Mexico, shared a heartfelt story about her late husband, who lived well beyond expectations after heart surgery, which she attributed in part to the use of COQ10 (coenzyme Q10). A cardiologist once pulled her aside to tell her that her actions had significantly extended her husband's life, a moment she considers a divine confirmation of her purpose to help others. Diane emphasized that her motivation isn't for recognition but to share knowledge that could benefit others with heart conditions. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Cat Man from Arizona recalled a near-death, out-of-body experience he had 20 years ago after being hit by an SUV in Las Vegas while crossing the street. He described feeling elated after making his first sale at a new job, then suddenly finding himself on a median, looking back at his own body lying on the ground. He vividly remembered seeing a woman cover his legs with a blanket, which later vanished without explanation, as no one at the hospital remembered her. Cat Man said he was abruptly pushed back into his body, interpreting it as a sign that it wasn't his time to die. During the out-of-body phase, he reported feeling peaceful and pain-free, but experienced intense pain upon reentry, particularly from a broken leg.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Eric the &quot;mind control guy,&quot; called in to express interest in a Coast show focused on Men in Black (MIB) encounters and shared that he had experienced one himself. He speculated that MIBs could be aliens, humans, or hybrids, and suggested they possess advanced technology that allows them to know when someone witnesses something unusual, like a UFO or cryptid. Eric emphasized how elusive these entities are and how difficult it is to capture or retain evidence due to their ability to erase traces and retrieve recordings.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Double Vision","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001CDNLJ6/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Night Life","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VYVVPX5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VYVVPX5"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Head Games","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VWMT9CG/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"I Want To Know What Love Is","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KWLAP6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KWLAP6"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Cold As Ice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002GZQ4WK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002GZQ4WK"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Juke Box Hero","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001CDL4Y0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001CDL4Y0"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Hot Blooded","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001CDKFYK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001CDKFYK"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Feels Like The First Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002GZRP00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002GZRP00"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Long, Long Way From Home","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002GZTM0Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002GZTM0Q"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Urgent","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001CDJM3K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001CDJM3K"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"That Was Yesterday","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KWN95A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KWN95A"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Blue Morning, Blue Day","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001BZJKWC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001BZJKWC"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Dirty White Boy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B009FIKEAY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B009FIKEAY"},{"artist":"Foreigner","title":"Waiting For A Girl Like You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001CDHEL2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001CDHEL2"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6813e669e0a801f6b5f0535b","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/cardiac health","keywords/heart health"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/681f2fbbe7ed6f1a443d6739","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 9 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/681f2fcae7ed6f1a443d673a","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 9 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/681f2fd7e7ed6f1a443d673b","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 9 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/681f2fe4e7ed6f1a443d673c","show":"coast","title":"Fri, May 9 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Human heart, artwork","id":"%2F68141358d5dec3bc94ef01de","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/68141358d5dec3bc94ef01de","source_credit":"PIXOLOGICSTUDIO / Science Photo Library / Getty Images","title":"Human heart, artwork","url":"asset://assets.getty/68141358d5dec3bc94ef01de","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1746799200000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2025-05-09-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Natural health advocate \u003ca href=\"http://cardiomiracle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>John Hewlett\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared his journey developing Cardio Miracle, a nitric oxide supplement that he says supports immune and heart health.

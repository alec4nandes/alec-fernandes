She joined guest host \u003ca href=\"http://theawareshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Garr\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://theawareshow.com/contact12/\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss her ability to communicate with the deceased, the concept of soul contracts, and her work on cold cases. Sheppard described how she uses her entire body and all her senses to connect with spirits. She explained that when communicating with spirits, she perceives their personalities and life experiences, such as whether they were quiet, talkative, creative, or had other defining traits. These characteristics help her interpret messages for the person she is reading for. Sheppard revealed she often experiences sensations like tastes, smells, and emotions that give her insight into the spirit's identity and message.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sheppard touched on the concept of soul contracts, which she believes are agreements made before birth to learn specific life lessons. She emphasized that these lessons often come from challenging experiences and relationships that push individuals to grow and evolve. By understanding the patterns in their lives, such as recurring themes of judgment or abandonment, people can shift their perspectives and gain valuable insights into their spiritual growth, she explained. This process, according to Sheppard, involves recognizing and confronting one's shadow side—the aspects of oneself that are often hidden or suppressed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sheppard talked about her involvement with cold cases. She mentioned her interest in helping with cold cases, often offering assistance by connecting with spirits to gather insights or information that might not be accessible through conventional means. Sheppard shared that she approaches these cases with the intent of providing closure or aiding investigations, although she is mindful of the sensitive nature of such work and respects the emotional states of those involved. She also emphasized the importance of ethics and integrity when working on cold cases, ensuring that she does not overstep boundaries or give false hope.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://marielhemingway.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Mariel Hemingway\u003c/a> is considered an expert in health—both mental and physical—and is a longtime advocate of personal power, life balance, authenticity, joy, and finding peace of mind through a devoted practice of healthy living. In the first 90 minutes, she shared her journey of mental health, finding balance, and overcoming trauma.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hemingway discussed her upbringing in an eccentric family marked by unspoken trauma, addiction, and mental health struggles. Growing up in a chaotic environment, particularly within her home, she found solace in nature and became an observer of her family's dysfunction. Despite the turmoil, she did not succumb to the same path of addiction that her sisters did, instead choosing to focus on health and wellness as a way to avoid the negative effects she witnessed. Her role in the family often felt like that of a caretaker or &quot;fixer,&quot; especially when she took on responsibilities like cleaning up after her parents' tumultuous dinner parties, she revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hemingway reflected on her connection to spirituality and nature, which she credited as vital to her emotional and mental well-being. Even from a young age, she prayed for her mother's recovery from cancer and felt a strong connection to God, despite her family not being particularly religious.

nationally syndicated program, \u003cem>Coast to Coast AM\u003c/em>, says if he weren&rsquo;t a  national radio talk show host he&rsquo;d be in politics. Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Her fears were rested when she determined that there is sufficient proof that we don't die.      The death of her father caused Sandra to investigate the world of grief.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

She joined guest host \u003ca href=\"http://theawareshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Garr\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://theawareshow.com/contact12/\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss her ability to communicate with the deceased, the concept of soul contracts, and her work on cold cases. Sheppard described how she uses her entire body and all her senses to connect with spirits. She explained that when communicating with spirits, she perceives their personalities and life experiences, such as whether they were quiet, talkative, creative, or had other defining traits. These characteristics help her interpret messages for the person she is reading for. Sheppard revealed she often experiences sensations like tastes, smells, and emotions that give her insight into the spirit's identity and message.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sheppard touched on the concept of soul contracts, which she believes are agreements made before birth to learn specific life lessons. She emphasized that these lessons often come from challenging experiences and relationships that push individuals to grow and evolve. By understanding the patterns in their lives, such as recurring themes of judgment or abandonment, people can shift their perspectives and gain valuable insights into their spiritual growth, she explained. This process, according to Sheppard, involves recognizing and confronting one's shadow side—the aspects of oneself that are often hidden or suppressed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sheppard talked about her involvement with cold cases. She mentioned her interest in helping with cold cases, often offering assistance by connecting with spirits to gather insights or information that might not be accessible through conventional means. Sheppard shared that she approaches these cases with the intent of providing closure or aiding investigations, although she is mindful of the sensitive nature of such work and respects the emotional states of those involved. She also emphasized the importance of ethics and integrity when working on cold cases, ensuring that she does not overstep boundaries or give false hope.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://marielhemingway.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Mariel Hemingway\u003c/a> is considered an expert in health—both mental and physical—and is a longtime advocate of personal power, life balance, authenticity, joy, and finding peace of mind through a devoted practice of healthy living. In the first 90 minutes, she shared her journey of mental health, finding balance, and overcoming trauma.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hemingway discussed her upbringing in an eccentric family marked by unspoken trauma, addiction, and mental health struggles. Growing up in a chaotic environment, particularly within her home, she found solace in nature and became an observer of her family's dysfunction. Despite the turmoil, she did not succumb to the same path of addiction that her sisters did, instead choosing to focus on health and wellness as a way to avoid the negative effects she witnessed. Her role in the family often felt like that of a caretaker or &quot;fixer,&quot; especially when she took on responsibilities like cleaning up after her parents' tumultuous dinner parties, she revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hemingway reflected on her connection to spirituality and nature, which she credited as vital to her emotional and mental well-being. Even from a young age, she prayed for her mother's recovery from cancer and felt a strong connection to God, despite her family not being particularly religious. This connection to the outdoors and nature gave her a sense of grounding and peace, which she associates with a higher power. Her focus on simple, natural practices, which she calls the &quot;seven doctors&quot; (sun, air, water, exercise, nutrition, earth, and rest), has been instrumental in her journey toward finding balance and maintaining mental health.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Out-Came-Sun-Overcoming-Addiction/dp/1941393233/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Out Came the Sun\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Finding-My-Balance-Memoir-Yoga/dp/0743264320/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Finding My Balance\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Badfinger","title":"Perfection","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004619EDI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Palmer","title":"Sneakin' Sally Through The Alley","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V672Y0/ctoc"},{"artist":"Duran Duran","title":"The Chauffeur","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ND0I8Q/ctoc"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Black Cow","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLB913N/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Belle Stars","title":"Iko Iko","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q62H5WP/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Your Mother Should Know","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FSXHY6P/ctoc"},{"artist":"Nirvana","title":"Oh Me","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWKVXI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Big Star","title":"September Gurls","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B6XTMQ2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Eels","title":"Novocaine For The Soul","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQH3CLZM/ctoc"},{"artist":"R.E.M.","title":"What's The Frequency Kenneth","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZK9P8S8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Belly","title":"Feed The Tree","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003A913FE/ctoc"},{"artist":"Oasis","title":"Don't Look Back In Anger","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089XV122D/ctoc"},{"artist":"Ween","title":"The Mollusk","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OGROM6/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Velvet Underground","title":"Sunday Morning","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S8P7IA/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66d0f58e3083bcb2f5c43214","%2F66d0f6df5ea7dfc2d80b4bd2"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa85e6d71999f70ab1b9d1"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Lisa Garr"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/life balance","keywords/self-empowerment","keywords/Psychic Medium","keywords/communicating with the departed"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d450c5b2a5901b18921945","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d450d9b2a5901b18921946","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d450f1b2a5901b18921947","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d45102b2a5901b18921948","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A mystical concept of a ghostly woman in a dress looking at a sky full of stars.","id":"%2F66d111ce121e4ca481bb7e7d","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66d111ce121e4ca481bb7e7d","source_credit":"David Wall / Moment / Getty Images","title":"A mystical concept of a ghostly woman in a dress looking at a sky full of stars.","url":"asset://assets.getty/66d111ce121e4ca481bb7e7d","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1725112800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-31-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Psychic medium \u003ca href=\"https://debsheppard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Deb Sheppard\u003c/a> discussed her ability to communicate with the deceased, the concept of soul contracts, and her work on cold cases.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

href=\"https://debsheppard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Deb Sheppard\u003c/a>, an internationally recognized medium, psychic, author, and speaker, has connected thousands of people to their loved ones in spirit, helping bring life full circle. She joined guest host \u003ca href=\"http://theawareshow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lisa Garr\u003c/a> (\u003ca href=\"https://theawareshow.com/contact12/\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss her ability to communicate with the deceased, the concept of soul contracts, and her work on cold cases. Sheppard described how she uses her entire body and all her senses to connect with spirits. She explained that when communicating with spirits, she perceives their personalities and life experiences, such as whether they were quiet, talkative, creative, or had other defining traits. These characteristics help her interpret messages for the person she is reading for. Sheppard revealed she often experiences sensations like tastes, smells, and emotions that give her insight into the spirit's identity and message.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sheppard touched on the concept of soul contracts, which she believes are agreements made before birth to learn specific life lessons. She emphasized that these lessons often come from challenging experiences and relationships that push individuals to grow and evolve. By understanding the patterns in their lives, such as recurring themes of judgment or abandonment, people can shift their perspectives and gain valuable insights into their spiritual growth, she explained. This process, according to Sheppard, involves recognizing and confronting one's shadow side—the aspects of oneself that are often hidden or suppressed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sheppard talked about her involvement with cold cases. She mentioned her interest in helping with cold cases, often offering assistance by connecting with spirits to gather insights or information that might not be accessible through conventional means. Sheppard shared that she approaches these cases with the intent of providing closure or aiding investigations, although she is mindful of the sensitive nature of such work and respects the emotional states of those involved. She also emphasized the importance of ethics and integrity when working on cold cases, ensuring that she does not overstep boundaries or give false hope.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://marielhemingway.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Mariel Hemingway\u003c/a> is considered an expert in health—both mental and physical—and is a longtime advocate of personal power, life balance, authenticity, joy, and finding peace of mind through a devoted practice of healthy living. In the first 90 minutes, she shared her journey of mental health, finding balance, and overcoming trauma.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hemingway discussed her upbringing in an eccentric family marked by unspoken trauma, addiction, and mental health struggles. Growing up in a chaotic environment, particularly within her home, she found solace in nature and became an observer of her family's dysfunction. Despite the turmoil, she did not succumb to the same path of addiction that her sisters did, instead choosing to focus on health and wellness as a way to avoid the negative effects she witnessed. Her role in the family often felt like that of a caretaker or &quot;fixer,&quot; especially when she took on responsibilities like cleaning up after her parents' tumultuous dinner parties, she revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Hemingway reflected on her connection to spirituality and nature, which she credited as vital to her emotional and mental well-being. Even from a young age, she prayed for her mother's recovery from cancer and felt a strong connection to God, despite her family not being particularly religious. This connection to the outdoors and nature gave her a sense of grounding and peace, which she associates with a higher power. Her focus on simple, natural practices, which she calls the &quot;seven doctors&quot; (sun, air, water, exercise, nutrition, earth, and rest), has been instrumental in her journey toward finding balance and maintaining mental health.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Out-Came-Sun-Overcoming-Addiction/dp/1941393233/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Out Came the Sun\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Finding-My-Balance-Memoir-Yoga/dp/0743264320/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Finding My Balance\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Badfinger","title":"Perfection","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004619EDI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Robert Palmer","title":"Sneakin' Sally Through The Alley","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V672Y0/ctoc"},{"artist":"Duran Duran","title":"The Chauffeur","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ND0I8Q/ctoc"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Black Cow","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLB913N/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Belle Stars","title":"Iko Iko","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q62H5WP/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Your Mother Should Know","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FSXHY6P/ctoc"},{"artist":"Nirvana","title":"Oh Me","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWKVXI/ctoc"},{"artist":"Big Star","title":"September Gurls","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B6XTMQ2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Eels","title":"Novocaine For The Soul","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQH3CLZM/ctoc"},{"artist":"R.E.M.","title":"What's The Frequency Kenneth","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZK9P8S8/ctoc"},{"artist":"Belly","title":"Feed The Tree","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003A913FE/ctoc"},{"artist":"Oasis","title":"Don't Look Back In Anger","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089XV122D/ctoc"},{"artist":"Ween","title":"The Mollusk","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OGROM6/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Velvet Underground","title":"Sunday Morning","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009S8P7IA/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66d0f58e3083bcb2f5c43214","%2F66d0f6df5ea7dfc2d80b4bd2"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa85e6d71999f70ab1b9d1"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Lisa Garr"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/life balance","keywords/self-empowerment","keywords/Psychic Medium","keywords/communicating with the departed"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d450c5b2a5901b18921945","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d450d9b2a5901b18921946","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d450f1b2a5901b18921947","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66d45102b2a5901b18921948","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 31 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A mystical concept of a ghostly woman in a dress looking at a sky full of stars.","id":"%2F66d111ce121e4ca481bb7e7d","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66d111ce121e4ca481bb7e7d","source_credit":"David Wall / Moment / Getty Images","title":"A mystical concept of a ghostly woman in a dress looking at a sky full of stars.","url":"asset://assets.getty/66d111ce121e4ca481bb7e7d","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1725112800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-31-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Psychic medium \u003ca href=\"https://debsheppard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Deb Sheppard\u003c/a> discussed her ability to communicate with the deceased, the concept of soul contracts, and her work on cold cases.

During the first half of Friday's show, she discussed her abilities and work as a psychic medium. She elaborated on her diverse psychic abilities, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, and remote viewing, which allow her to see, hear, and even visit different places mentally. Boussarhhane mentioned how she frequently communicates with spirits and how people often seek her guidance to connect with deceased loved ones. Dream communication is a significant part of her work, and she explained how loved ones from the other side can easily connect with us through dreams. She recounted a story where a deceased friend appeared in a dream, which, for her, symbolized the person's peaceful transition to the afterlife.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhhane shared her experience as a kidney transplant recipient and how it has influenced her psychic abilities. She received a kidney from a deceased male donor in 2019 due to her own kidneys failing from polycystic kidney disease. According to Boussarhhane, the transplant not only physically saved her life but also enhanced her intuition, connecting her more deeply with the spiritual realm. She described having flashes of memories and cravings that she believes are connected to the donor's life. She revealed that the donor’s spirit conveyed gratitude and personal details, which she now incorporates into her work as a medium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhhane talked about her experiences with UFO sightings and remote viewing investigations of haunted locations, particularly in Pensacola, Florida, where she runs ghost tours. Pensacola's haunted history, dating back to the 1500s, provides a rich environment for paranormal activities. She believes that spirits often linger not because they have failed to move on, but because they want their stories to be remembered. Boussarhhane also touched on the nature of evil, suggesting that a combination of biological, environmental, and possibly spiritual factors could lead to the actions of people like serial killer Ted Bundy. She emphasized the importance of prayer and spirituality in developing psychic abilities and navigating the complexities of the human psyche.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Gary from Billings, Montana, shared a profound spiritual experience he had while in an inpatient treatment program. During a moment of reflection on his late grandparents, he felt a powerful energy flow from the top of his head down to his feet, which gave him a strong sense that everything would be okay. He interpreted this as a manifestation of the Holy Spirit, which provided him comfort and reassurance that life would improve, despite the usual ups and downs.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Joe from Pittsburgh shared a paranormal experience he had during a solo trip to Washington, D.C. in 2011. After attending a Tori Amos concert, he encountered a strange phenomenon in his hotel room. The room slightly warmed, and his body hairs stood up just before he saw an orb, larger than a ping pong ball, float across the room and disappear into the wall. The atmosphere returned to normal immediately after. Joe did not sense any malevolence from the orb, attributing it to a benign paranormal presence. He also mentioned past paranormal experiences and his interest in lucid dreaming and out-of-body experiences.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Tim from Titusville, Florida, called into a show to share his long-time connection to the program, having listened since the mid-90s. He reminisced about various hosts and memorable moments, including the passing of Ian, which deeply affected him. Tim also recounted a strange experience while traveling in North Carolina, where his wife met a woman who revealed that her son was tragically killed in the infamous Joplin tornado after being sucked out of a car's sunroof. The coincidence of meeting the woman left Tim and his wife deeply moved.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final half-hour featured a replay from \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2014-10-31-show/\" target=\"_blank\">10/31/2014\u003c/a> when author Tabitha Prock shared paranormal stories from Monroe County, Tennessee.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://heidihollis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Heidi Hollis\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> / \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Boogie-Man-Ericka-Boussarhane/dp/1438931077/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Sam and the Boogie Man\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://psychicdiva.thinkific.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Psychic &amp;

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He praised the nutritional advantages of hemp, stating it has an ideal balance of omega fatty acids, positioning it as a superfood amid rising health concerns like obesity and diabetes. Fine advocated for easing regulations on hemp cultivation, especially for independent farmers, suggesting that if we get hemp into increased acreage, &quot;that's going to mean economic recovery for family farms.&quot; Hemp seeds can sell for $1 a pound, making a 1,000-acre crop worth a million dollars, which is significantly more than corn, he noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Despite being legal in all 50 states, cultivating hemp requires a permit and government inspection, and Fine was critical of this bureaucratic process. &quot;We've got to make it easier, rather than harder, for farmers to grow hemp,&quot; he added. Hemp has a great deal of versatility in its usage, he pointed out. The draft of the Declaration of Independence was written on hemp and the crop can be transformed into eco-friendly products, including clothing and paper. Plus, hemp has a remarkable quality as a &quot;phyto-remediator&quot; capable of cleaning contaminated soil, illustrating its potential role in sustainable agriculture. Additionally, he announced his upcoming documentary, &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://santafefilmfestival.com/index/film/american-hemp-farmer/\" target=\"_blank\">American Hemp Farmer\u003c/a>,&quot; which recently won an award at the Santa Fe Film Festival.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, C2C's investigative reporter \u003ca href=\"http://cherylljones.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Cheryll Jones\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared her interview with author &amp; researcher \u003ca href=\"http://peterakirby.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Kirby\u003c/a> on the controversial topic of chemtrails. He suggested that chemtrails are part of a larger scheme of geoengineering and weather modification. Kirby contended that the manipulation of the atmosphere can be traced back decades, with roots in military applications, such as weather modification during the Vietnam War. He dubbed the phenomenon &quot;the new Manhattan Project,&quot; emphasizing its historical connections to early scientific endeavors that evolved into contemporary geoengineering efforts. &quot;What we're really talking about here is geophysical warfare,&quot; he told Cheryll, adding that there could be financial motives linked to the practice, like the weather derivatives markets.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He reported on the recent \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/tennessee-lawmakers-ban-geoengineering-allusions-chemtrails-rcna145015\" target=\"_blank\">legislative response\u003c/a> in the state of Tennessee aimed at curbing aerosol spraying and weather modification. &quot;Once you realize that these things are going on, you immediately know that it's unacceptable,&quot; he commented. Kirby further argued that geoengineering is part of a broader &quot;globalist agenda&quot; aimed at controlling human activity and weather patterns, describing it as &quot;an agenda of control.&quot; There is evidence, he continued, that chemtrails contain toxic substances like coal fly ash that are harmful to humans and ecosystems. While mainstream narratives have consistently dismissed chemtrails as conspiracy theory, he believes public awareness is shifting.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://nelkenfoodsafetycoach.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Jeff Nelken\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/American-Hemp-Farmer-Adventures-Misadventures/dp/1603589198/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>American Hemp Farmer\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Chemtrails-Exposed-Manhattan-Project-second/dp/B088BFZTRD/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Chemtrails Exposed: A New Manhattan Project\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Unknown Paradise","url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DLKJGE2/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Sedaka","title":"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07DFK3JWY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07DFK3JWY"},{"artist":"Frank Zappa","title":"Peaches En Regalia","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00B2Z1G1Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00B2Z1G1Y"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Once In A Lifetime","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Remain-Light-Talking-Heads/dp/B001OGRQAQ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Lucky Jack","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Lucky-Jack-Remastered-Basswolf/dp/B01K60GZNE"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"I Am, I Said","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000028OJ/ctoc"},{"artist":"Edgar Winter","title":"Frankenstein","url":"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000024Z3/ctoc"},{"artist":"The Zombies","title":"Time Of The Season","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07JYG78LL/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07JYG78LL"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Sadeness-Part-1-Enigma/dp/B000005JWS/ctoc"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"http://www.amazon.com/Solitary-Man-Album-Version/dp/B00136RV52/ctoc"},{"artist":"Emerson Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"L.A.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

On the distinction between obsession and possession, he explained that &quot;it's a continuum&quot; and that while some may be possessed by negative emotions, others can experience positive forms of possession, such as being inspired by the Holy Spirit.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A case from the 1980s triggered Stavish's fascination with the idea of demonic possession. \u003ca href=\"https://unsolved.com/gallery/don-decker/\" target=\"_blank\">Don Decker\u003c/a>, known as the &quot;Rain Man,&quot; reportedly caused it to rain indoors, and credible observers, including police and clergy witnessed this. Eventually, he underwent an exorcism by a jail chaplain. Regarding exorcisms that he's witnessed himself, Stavish characterized them as &quot;extended blessings&quot; rather than the dramatic rituals portrayed in the media, and revealed that they may take numerous sessions to be effective. He suggested that individuals lacking a spiritual routine or foundation may be more vulnerable to unwanted paranormal experiences. &quot;Taking control of your own mind, taking control of your life, is really the best protection,&quot; he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Citizen researcher \u003ca href=\"http://www.paranormaluniversalpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Dr. Kelly Renee Schutz\u003c/u>\u003c/a> is an intuitive empath with psychic, clairaudient, and telepathic abilities.

Regarding psychokinesis (the ability to move objects with the mind), she described incidents around her, like drawers suddenly flying open and nearby objects flying or breaking. She also discussed her success in casinos, attributing her wins to telepathic guidance-- &quot;I just say the words, find me the winning machine,&quot; and a voice guides her to a lucky slot machine, &quot;and I usually win the jackpot within 10 to 20 minutes.&quot; Schutz reports that she has won some 20 IRS-documented jackpots; she believes she has a particular sensitivity to electronic devices.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She shared her spine-chilling encounter in a haunted Wales bed and breakfast.

Reflecting on her lifelong fascination with the supernatural, she advised to &quot;be careful what you wish for.&quot; Schutz also described a mysterious handprint that appeared on her body after a night of strange occurrences, as she pondered the fine line between paranormal and extraterrestrial phenomena, stating, &quot;I'm just putting the pieces together and trying to figure out... what exactly is this energy that I'm experiencing?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Studies-Poltergeists-Obsession-Possession-Institute/dp/1533167230/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Studies in Poltergeists, Obsession, &amp; Possession\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Egregores-Occult-Entities-Watch-Destiny/dp/1620555778/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Egregores: The Occult Entities That Watch Over Human Destiny\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Between-Gates-Dreaming-Projection-Esotericism/dp/1578633966/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Between the Gates\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Haunted-Life-Kelly-Renee-Schutz/dp/B09WN39JP9/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Haunted Life ...

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he discussed how war with China is happening now from every angle, and what we can expect next. He outlined the transformation of China from a struggling nation during World War II to a formidable global power, attributing this shift largely to American investment and technological support. He expressed concern over the miscalculation of American leaders, who believed engagement would lead to liberalization, stating, &quot;The Americans were able to convince themselves... that China really wasn't a threat.&quot; He described ongoing economic and drug warfare as insidious forms of conflict, remarking that &quot;China has killed a million Americans without firing a shot&quot; through fentanyl, most of which originates from their country.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He warned that losing Taiwan to China would significantly undermine US credibility in Asia, stating, &quot;Every country in Asia... would be wondering just how reliable an ally is the United States.&quot; Newsham commented that China is meticulously learning from Russia's mistakes in Ukraine, suggesting that if they attacked Taiwan, they would hit hard and isolate the island nation by cutting off its Internet access. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) views Taiwan as a critical military and psychological target, and he predicted that its fall would prompt other Asian countries to seek favor with China. He further characterized the CCP as primarily about getting and keeping power, and using that to its advantage.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Author and noted biologist \u003ca href=\"http://globalscience.biz/about\" target=\"_blank\">Elliott Haimoff\u003c/a> is the founder of Global Science Productions, a TV documentary production company. In the latter half, he shared his work interviewing over 30 Apollo astronauts and top NASA officials of that era about their personal journeys and professional milestones that have shaped the landscape of space travel. Sharing little-known details about the early space race, he revealed that the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was not the first man in space, and there was evidence of several cosmonauts who preceded him. He elaborated on Gagarin's tragic death at 34, hinting at foul play. Haimoff recalled astronaut Gordon Cooper's report of seeing a UFO-- while NASA dismissed his claims, there was speculation about the confiscation of his film. As this was the height of the Cold War, national security may have played a role in suppressing such narratives.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Haimoff touched on the lives of astronauts like Edgar Mitchell, Buzz Aldrin, James Irwin, and Alan Bean, and fondly recounted his interview with Harrison Schmitt, who shared insights about lunar colonization. &quot;He spent hours talking about his findings on the moon… a very unexpected surprise.&quot; As to why astronauts have not returned to the Moon, Haimoff remarked that the race to the Moon was a &quot;goal-oriented event,&quot; and without the competition, the urgency faded away. A potential new space race might develop, particularly regarding helium-3, which is found on the Moon and can be used as an energy source for nuclear fusion. Haimoff also offered his theory on the 1908 Tunguska incident in Siberia, theorizing that the blast might have been a UFO crash rather than a meteor, based on the radiation evidence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://harrydent.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Harry Dent\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He described the current program as &quot;one big, catastrophic failure,&quot; attributing its issues to a lack of safeguards and the collusion between universities and lenders. &quot;They created a license to steal,&quot; he claimed. Collinge noted that approximately 85% of federal student loan borrowers cannot make payments, worsened by the economic aftermath of COVID-19. He argued for the restoration of bankruptcy protections for student loans, stating, &quot;We need justice... this is predatory lending at its worst.&quot; He also pointed out a common misconception about borrowers. &quot;Most student loan borrowers are over the age of 35,&quot; he revealed. &quot;This is not a younger person's problem.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The current predatory lending system, according to Collinge, started with the removal of bankruptcy protections from student loans in the 1970s. He noted that many borrowers have repaid amounts far exceeding their original loans, yet are still burdened with debt. &quot;They were essentially signed onto a bond of indenture,&quot; he said. Collinge criticized both sides of the political aisle for abandoning student loan borrowers, asserting, &quot;We have no party that we can trust at this point.&quot; He also announced his presidential candidacy, which aims to pressure Washington to restore bankruptcy rights for student loans. He believes the government should not profit from these loans, calling for a return to the &quot;zero interest&quot; model once supported by president Lyndon Johnson. Overall, Collinge advocated for a complete overhaul of how higher education is funded, saying, &quot;The entire lending system, by all rational metrics, has just failed.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, bestselling authors and identical twins Ophira and Tali Edut — \u003ca href=\"http://astrostyle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The AstroTwins\u003c/a> — revealed how to maximize one's potential with a simple yet powerful astrological system. The two shared how they stumbled upon astrology during their time at the University of Michigan, where a 30-page birth chart gifted to Ophira sparked their fascination. Tali followed suit, and together they began analyzing the charts of friends and celebrities, noting patterns and connections that fueled their passion for astrology. &quot;The birth chart really is like a map to your soul,&quot; Tali insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A significant aspect of their work is the I.A.M. system, which stands for Innovator, Authority, and Maven. The system simplifies astrology by categorizing individuals based on their chart's dominant elements. Innovators are associated with cardinal signs, Authorities with fixed signs, and Mavens with mutable signs. This approach lets people quickly identify their behavioral “archetype” and apply it to decision-making in daily life. &quot;We noticed that people were fascinated by astrology, but it’s an incredibly hard language to retain,&quot; Tali explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>As the twins discussed their forecasts for the upcoming presidential elections, they revealed insights into the astrological charts of the major candidates. They noted that Donald Trump has a more favorable chart for Election Day, with Jupiter, the planet of luck, positioned over his sun and north node. &quot;If he is meant to be the president, then he's lined up pretty well for it,&quot; Ophira stated. Conversely, Kamala Harris's chart emphasizes the importance of her team and supporters in mobilizing votes, indicating that her campaign should focus on grassroots efforts. The AstroTwins also touched on the growth of astrology in the digital age, noting how apps and social media have made astrological knowledge more accessible. &quot;Now everybody knows where every planet was when they were born, and it's pretty amazing how astrology has really caught on,” Tali said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Steve Kates aka Dr. Sky\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Student-Loan-Scam-Oppressive-History/dp/0807042315/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Student Loan Scam\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Astrology-Advantage-Horoscope-Personal-Professional/dp/1668017202/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Astrology Advantage\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Rhythm of the Wilderness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GN14UY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GN14UY"},{"artist":"Michael Bublé","title":"I Believe in You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01KGM5SOO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01KGM5SOO"},{"artist":"Blackalicious","title":"Swan Lake","url":"https://amazon.com/Swan-Lake-Blackalicious/dp/B000003LW3/ctoc/?2"},{"artist":"YES","title":"Owner of a Lonely Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122UIOI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122UIOI"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Ghost Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM878/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM878"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TR9Q08Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00TR9Q08Q"},{"artist":"The Fixx","title":"Secret Separation","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CFDH4D3Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CFDH4D3Y"},{"artist":"Enya","title":"Only Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002N8TJ4K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002N8TJ4K"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Modern Crusaders","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCW9A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCW9A"},{"artist":"Dionne Warwick","title":"Anyone Who Had a Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002C7HRC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002C7HRC8"},{"artist":"Bruce Hornsby","title":"The Way It Is","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SQA0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SQA0"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday on My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XKC7S9M/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XKC7S9M"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Principles Of Lust","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD72TK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD72TK"},{"artist":"Echo And The Bunnymen","title":"Lips Like Sugar","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122B4T6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122B4T6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00f418537fd678a3ecf126","%2F66c7d3a7fb4efdbcbcee0a92","%2F66c7d2b08ea8fb9235f5499c"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/student loans","keywords/astrology"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cdabd9b5272d96f341de22","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 26 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cdabe6b5272d96f341de23","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 26 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cdabf4b5272d96f341de24","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 26 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cdac02b5272d96f341de25","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 26 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Zodiac signs and astrology with constellations, concepts, predictions, horoscopes, beliefs","id":"%2F66c7e624198bee62ee10bf96","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66c7e624198bee62ee10bf96","source_credit":"Surasak Suwanmake / Moment / Getty Images","title":"Zodiac signs and astrology with constellations, concepts, predictions, horoscopes, beliefs","url":"asset://assets.getty/66c7e624198bee62ee10bf96","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1724680800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-26-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://studentloanjustice.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Collinge\u003c/a> discussed the predatory student loan system, as well as his fight to establish consumer protections for these loans.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

he observed. As he navigates the whirlwind of media attention following the release of his book \u003cem>Imminent: Inside the Pentagon's Hunt for UFOs\u003c/em>, Elizondo remains focused on fostering an open dialogue about UAPs, insisting that &quot;we have one chance to do it right.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, former UK counter-intelligence officer \u003ca href=\"https://independent.academia.edu/francmilburn\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Franc Milburn\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared his investigation into the mysterious death of Amy Eskridge — a talented scientist conducting groundbreaking research. Eskridge, who described herself as a &quot;paperclipper,&quot; had family connections to Operation Paperclip, where German scientists were brought to the U.S. post-World War II to advance the space program. &quot;She was one of those people that you call a flyer, off the charts in terms of intelligence,&quot; Milburn noted, before describing how her life took a troubling turn. He revealed that Amy had been a victim of group stalking and unusual occurrences for several years prior to their friendship. &quot;Initially it started with overt and covert surveillance and harassment,&quot; he explained, noting instances where her vehicle was tampered with.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Eskridge's work involved sensitive projects related to anti-gravity, and she was also vocal in her concern about weaponizing free energy — a process that could literally rip apart space-time. According to Milburn, Eskridge's professional opinions may have put her life in danger. He expressed deep concerns about the circumstances surrounding her death, which has been labeled a suicide. &quot;I have some pretty major questions about whether that's the reality,&quot; he stated. The lack of a thorough investigation and the swift cremation of her body only deepen the mystery. Many of her colleagues also experienced severe intimidation tactics. &quot;Two of them... called me up... and were very, very terrified,&quot; Milburn recounted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003ch3>\u003cstrong>KNAPP'S NEWS:\u003c/strong>\u003c/h3>\n\n\u003cp>George Knapp shared recent items of interest, including articles about the Big Bang and quantum teleportation:\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.space.com/intelligent-alien-life-rare-drake-equation-research?utm_term=59CCC90C-63ED-481E-AC34-C0A4C89C1A81&lrh=8b1b39919f96722a3e08d7869213e5a40f7d73e3c57526c0ae8b51958548f46e&utm_campaign=58E4DE65-C57F-4CD3-9A5A-609994E2C5A9&utm_medium=email&utm_content=CB64B9C6-BE9B-4509-BEF2-55E5EF675E85&utm_source=SmartBrief\" target=\"_blank\">Are we alone?

Quayle mentioned the world is currently experiencing events that were once hidden in ancient history but are now unfolding before our eyes, such as unidentified aerial and underwater phenomena. He emphasized the importance of understanding pre- and post-Adamic civilizations, which he claimed were not human but angelic or supernatural beings whose records are inscribed in stones, stars, and oral traditions. Quayle suggested that these revelations are connected to forbidden history, which has been deliberately suppressed by governments and institutions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Quayle delved into the concepts of Stargates, portals, and wormholes, explaining that they are not interchangeable but serve as gateways to other dimensions or locations in the universe. He connected these phenomena to ancient symbols and petroglyphs found across the world, particularly in pre-flood cultures. Quayle argued that these gateways are opening more frequently, which he associates with increasing paranormal activity and the emergence of evil forces on Earth. He tied these ideas to biblical prophecies, particularly the notion that the &quot;Gates of Hell&quot; are opening, leading to a global conflict between good and evil. Quayle also touched on the role of sound, symbols, and specific rituals in activating these gateways, suggesting that this knowledge was preserved and passed down through various ancient civilizations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Quayle focused on the Grand Canyon, where he claimed Egyptian artifacts have been discovered and subsequently hidden by institutions like the Smithsonian. He provided anecdotal evidence of a cover-up involving these artifacts and suggested that the Grand Canyon was a significant site for both pre- and post-flood Egyptian exploration. Quayle also discussed the broader implications of these findings, linking them to a global effort to suppress alternative histories that challenge mainstream narratives. He highlighted the increasing visibility of these hidden truths in modern media and the need for further exploration and understanding of these phenomena.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://whocanhebe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Rolfe\u003c/a> is one of the foremost British experts on the Shroud of Turin. In the first hour, he delved into its history, the nature of the image, and evidence for its authenticity. Rolfe examined the mysterious nature of the image on the cloth, explaining that it resides only on the topmost fibers without penetrating the fabric, which suggests an immense burst of energy over an infinitesimally short time. This has led some to speculate that the image might have been created at the moment of Jesus' resurrection. The shroud's history traces back to Edessa (modern-day Urfa, Turkey), where it was revered as a holy relic, eventually finding its way to Constantinople and later to Turin, Italy, after being taken by Crusaders. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The shroud has been subject to extensive scientific analysis, including controversial carbon dating tests in the 1980s that suggested it was a medieval forgery, though later discoveries, such as the presence of pollen and accurate forensic details of crucifixion, challenge that conclusion. Rolfe, once an atheist, has been deeply influenced by the shroud's evidence, considering it possibly as a form of the Second Coming. He also touched on modern technological advances like CGI and AI, which have further unveiled the shroud's details, adding to its intrigue and ongoing debate about its authenticity.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Genesis-Builders-Prehistoric-Ancient-Civilizations/dp/0972134700/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Genesis 6 Giants Master Builders of Prehistoric and Ancient Civilizations\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.safetrek.com/product/terminated-the-end-of-man-is-here/\" target=\"_blank\">TERMINATED – the End of Man is Here\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Yes","title":"Owner of a Lonely Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122UIOI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122UIOI"},{"artist":"New Radicals","title":"You Get What You Give","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09K3ZWWQF/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Genesis","title":"Land of Confusion","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0046OP2CC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0046OP2CC"},{"artist":"Billie Eilish","title":"Birds of a Feather","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CZW15FZZ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CZW15FZZ"},{"artist":"Coldplay","title":"The Scientist","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KHEHJ3K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00KHEHJ3K"},{"artist":"The Waterboys","title":"The Whole of the Moon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0B3SD25H1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0B3SD25H1"},{"artist":"Twenty One Pilots","title":"Stressed Out","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00UC9F0FO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00UC9F0FO"},{"artist":"Harry Styles","title":"Matilda","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09WTLVVJD/ctoc/?trackAsin=B09WTLVVJD"},{"artist":"The Alarm","title":"Sold Me Down The River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SZEXWI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SZEXWI"},{"artist":"Dire Straits","title":"So Far Away","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NHETNS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NHETNS"},{"artist":"Sade","title":"Soldier of Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01AIRHO3K/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Niall Horan","title":"Slow Hands","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B071RMWPYV/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Counting Crows","title":"Round Here","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W0YPL8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W0YPL8"},{"artist":"The 1975","title":"Oh Caroline","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0B5HSHXKK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0B5HSHXKK"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66c7d06ec8b019dc27ce4903","%2F5dffca08537fd678a3ece427"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/Shroud of Turin","keywords/UFOs"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cb16d4890d4f67806ee5a3","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 24 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cb16e6890d4f67806ee5a4","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 24 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cb16f5890d4f67806ee5a5","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 24 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66cb170f890d4f67806ee5a6","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 24 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"","id":"%2F66c7de34fbc2b1be3080413a","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66c7de34fbc2b1be3080413a","source_credit":"Philippe Lissac / The Image Bank Unreleased / Getty Images","title":"Shroud of Turin","url":"asset://assets.getty/66c7de34fbc2b1be3080413a","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1724508000000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2024-08-24-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Researcher \u003ca href=\"http://stevequayle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Steve Quayle\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed a range of extraordinary topics focusing on hidden and ancient histories, unexplained phenomena, and what he believes are the implications for the future.

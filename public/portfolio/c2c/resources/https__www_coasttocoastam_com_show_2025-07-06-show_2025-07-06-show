He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;</p>

<p>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.</p>

<p>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.</p>

<p>----------------</p>

<p>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher <a href="https://jillmjackson.com/" target="_blank">Jill M. Jackson</a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.</p>

<p>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.</p>

<p>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;</p>

the first half, \u003ca href=\"https://physiciansuntoldstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Scott Kolbaba\u003c/a>, an accomplished internal medicine physician and Marine Corps veteran, discussed his mysterious and miraculous medical experiences. He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://softwar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Charles R.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://softwar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Charles R.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

the first half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://ivordavisbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Ivor Davis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared revelations about Elvis Presley, as we near the 48th anniversary of his death, as well as observations about the Beatles, whom Davis had firsthand experiences. He detailed Elvis' decline in the 1970s, recalling a Vegas performance where Elvis &quot;was looking like a balloon&quot; and even forgot the lyrics to &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight,&quot; leaving the audience &quot;staggered.&quot; Davis emphasized the tragic dimension of Elvis' life, including the impact of his mother's death: &quot;The death of Gladys began the destruction, I think, of Elvis because he loved her, and she was so close to him.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Davis, Elvis was jealous of the Beatles' success, especially after their historic Shea Stadium concert. He revealed that Elvis disparaged them to President Nixon, calling them &quot;charlatans&quot; who &quot;bad mouthed America,&quot; a claim that alienated the British band. Davis contrasted the Beatles' influence on music with Presley's, with the Beatles credited for paving the way for future artists. He also recounted Presley's unusual request for a federal agent badge from Nixon, intended to help him avoid legal trouble, underscoring the singer's reliance on drugs and his entourage, known as the &quot;Memphis Mafia.&quot; Davis also discussed drug use among the Beatles, emphasizing that all members struggled with substances at various points.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He touched on Presley's relationship with Colonel Tom Parker, his manager, stating Parker &quot;manipulated Elvis&quot; by pushing him into formulaic movies to generate revenue. Parker was both a relentless promoter and a controlling figure, who pressured Elvis into an unsustainable schedule, such as &quot;800 performances at the Hilton Hotel&quot; over his career, Davis continued. Additionally, there was also the enabling behavior of Elvis' entourage, with none of them urging Elvis to take better care of himself, for fear of getting on his bad side.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, \u003ca href=\"http://www.theaveburyexperience.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Maria Wheatley\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cu>,\u003c/u> a master dowser and researcher of ancient sites, delved into Stonehenge and the site's purported healing properties, as well as the elongated skull people. She challenged the conventional dating of Stonehenge to 2500 BC, arguing that carbon dating evidence suggests it could be as old as 8000 BC. Wheatley emphasized Stonehenge's role beyond a mere calendar, proposing it functioned as a &quot;healing temple&quot; aligned with Earth energies and sound frequencies. She described a particular stone with a hole that &quot;miraculously&quot; filled with water even during droughts, used by ancient visitors for healing ailments. According to her research, the magnetic properties of the stones and their placement on Earth's energy lines emit &quot;infrasound and ultrasound&quot; frequencies conducive to healing and can even possibly repair damaged DNA.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wheatley concluded that the knowledge of Stonehenge's powers was not lost but &quot;repressed,&quot; passed down through Druids, the Knights Templar, and secret societies, persisting in sacred architecture and spiritual traditions. She described Stonehenge as a site that &quot;alters our state of consciousness,&quot; opening the &quot;third eye&quot; and facilitating psychic experiences. Regarding the Templars, she described them as spiritual &quot;geomancers&quot; who strategically positioned their churches atop potent Earth energies or ley lines.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wheatley revealed her discovery of three types of elongated skulls at Cambridge University, describing them as &quot;small in stature&quot; with &quot;long and elongated&quot; craniums and &quot;ear placements further back,&quot; giving them an &quot;almost mythical fairy look.&quot; She suggested these skulls belonged to a &quot;long lost legendary race.&quot; This group, along with a taller race of giants were linked to Stonehenge's region, she asserted, adding that &quot;It's a repressed history... these two cultures prevailed&quot; and archaeological and historical records support this.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, \u003ca href=\"https://physiciansuntoldstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Scott Kolbaba\u003c/a>, an accomplished internal medicine physician and Marine Corps veteran, discussed his mysterious and miraculous medical experiences. He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://softwar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Charles R.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

the first half, \u003ca href=\"https://physiciansuntoldstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Scott Kolbaba\u003c/a>, an accomplished internal medicine physician and Marine Corps veteran, discussed his mysterious and miraculous medical experiences. He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://softwar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Charles R.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://softwar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Charles R.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He has also documented many unexpected stories from his colleagues, and shared several anecdotes that reveal their encounters with the paranormal. One profound recollection involved a patient named Rosemary, who had a near-death experience during surgery. After going into cardiac arrest, she described rising to the ceiling of the operating room where she observed everything happening below, including details about the staff and environment. Most strikingly, she reported seeing her deceased grandmother, who told her, &quot;It wasn't her time to go.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This incident prompted Dr. Kolbaba to investigate whether other doctors had similar tales, and he was stunned by the number of colleagues who had witnessed inexplicable events. &quot;When I started asking everyone if they had any unusual stories that they couldn't explain scientifically, I was really shocked that there were many, many physicians that came forward,&quot; he stated. He discovered that these doctors were often hesitant to share their experiences due to fears of ridicule and reputational damage. However, As Dr. Kolbaba gathered these stories, he found that these miraculous events often strengthened the doctors' relationships with patients.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also included a frightening account involving his daughter's choir bus. After the vehicle caught fire, the flames receded at a critical moment, allowing all the students to escape unharmed. &quot;I think it was a miracle, and I think the kids that saw that would call it a miracle too,&quot; Dr. Kolbaba reflected. He elaborated on beliefs concerning the afterlife, noting a common thread among dying individuals' experiences: positive phenomena often characterized by love and peace. &quot;I think there's a veil between our world and the afterlife,&quot; he insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, psychic medium, and spiritual teacher \u003ca href=\"https://jillmjackson.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jill M. Jackson\u003c/a> shared her insights on manifesting and self-discovery. Jackson differentiated between psychics and mediums, explaining that &quot;a psychic reading is a different frequency than connecting to someone's loved ones who have transitioned.&quot; She noted that her natural affinity lies in mediumship, which enables her to connect with those in the spirit world. She recognized this gift early in her childhood when she first saw spirits, further evolving after a profound encounter with her recently deceased grandmother.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the topic of psychic readings, Jackson revealed that most inquiries center around life purpose and spiritual destiny. &quot;People are wanting to get in contact with their own soul's blueprint,&quot; she said. She also stressed the importance of manifesting from a higher state of consciousness. Her own personal struggles with trying to conceive a child led her to explore the deeper spiritual laws influencing manifestation. According to Jackson, her acceptance of this part of her journey facilitated deeper spiritual growth. &quot;When we learn to manifest from the higher self or the quantum, we understand that it's all about resonance and frequency rather than control,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jackson believes this understanding allows individuals to transcend limiting beliefs rooted in the ego, which often obstruct personal growth. The conversation also touched on the existence of evil and the role of fear in spiritual practices. Jackson asserts that while she believes in the manifestation of evil as an energy, she does not subscribe to traditional notions of a devil or hell. Jackson urged listeners to maintain elevated spirits, stating, &quot;Choose the lens of love. When we speak our authentic truth and we get into a place of trust and surrender, then everything else flows.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://softwar.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Charles R.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

of his death, as well as observations about the Beatles, whom Davis had firsthand experiences. He detailed Elvis' decline in the 1970s, recalling a Vegas performance where Elvis &quot;was looking like a balloon&quot; and even forgot the lyrics to &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight,&quot; leaving the audience &quot;staggered.&quot; Davis emphasized the tragic dimension of Elvis' life, including the impact of his mother's death: &quot;The death of Gladys began the destruction, I think, of Elvis because he loved her, and she was so close to him.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Davis, Elvis was jealous of the Beatles' success, especially after their historic Shea Stadium concert. He revealed that Elvis disparaged them to President Nixon, calling them &quot;charlatans&quot; who &quot;bad mouthed America,&quot; a claim that alienated the British band. Davis contrasted the Beatles' influence on music with Presley's, with the Beatles credited for paving the way for future artists. He also recounted Presley's unusual request for a federal agent badge from Nixon, intended to help him avoid legal trouble, underscoring the singer's reliance on drugs and his entourage, known as the &quot;Memphis Mafia.&quot; Davis also discussed drug use among the Beatles, emphasizing that all members struggled with substances at various points.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He touched on Presley's relationship with Colonel Tom Parker, his manager, stating Parker &quot;manipulated Elvis&quot; by pushing him into formulaic movies to generate revenue. Parker was both a relentless promoter and a controlling figure, who pressured Elvis into an unsustainable schedule, such as &quot;800 performances at the Hilton Hotel&quot; over his career, Davis continued. Additionally, there was also the enabling behavior of Elvis' entourage, with none of them urging Elvis to take better care of himself, for fear of getting on his bad side.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, \u003ca href=\"http://www.theaveburyexperience.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Maria Wheatley\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cu>,\u003c/u> a master dowser and researcher of ancient sites, delved into Stonehenge and the site's purported healing properties, as well as the elongated skull people. She challenged the conventional dating of Stonehenge to 2500 BC, arguing that carbon dating evidence suggests it could be as old as 8000 BC. Wheatley emphasized Stonehenge's role beyond a mere calendar, proposing it functioned as a &quot;healing temple&quot; aligned with Earth energies and sound frequencies. She described a particular stone with a hole that &quot;miraculously&quot; filled with water even during droughts, used by ancient visitors for healing ailments. According to her research, the magnetic properties of the stones and their placement on Earth's energy lines emit &quot;infrasound and ultrasound&quot; frequencies conducive to healing and can even possibly repair damaged DNA.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wheatley concluded that the knowledge of Stonehenge's powers was not lost but &quot;repressed,&quot; passed down through Druids, the Knights Templar, and secret societies, persisting in sacred architecture and spiritual traditions.

I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

the first half, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://ivordavisbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Ivor Davis\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared revelations about Elvis Presley, as we near the 48th anniversary of his death, as well as observations about the Beatles, whom Davis had firsthand experiences. He detailed Elvis' decline in the 1970s, recalling a Vegas performance where Elvis &quot;was looking like a balloon&quot; and even forgot the lyrics to &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight,&quot; leaving the audience &quot;staggered.&quot; Davis emphasized the tragic dimension of Elvis' life, including the impact of his mother's death: &quot;The death of Gladys began the destruction, I think, of Elvis because he loved her, and she was so close to him.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Davis, Elvis was jealous of the Beatles' success, especially after their historic Shea Stadium concert. He revealed that Elvis disparaged them to President Nixon, calling them &quot;charlatans&quot; who &quot;bad mouthed America,&quot; a claim that alienated the British band. Davis contrasted the Beatles' influence on music with Presley's, with the Beatles credited for paving the way for future artists. He also recounted Presley's unusual request for a federal agent badge from Nixon, intended to help him avoid legal trouble, underscoring the singer's reliance on drugs and his entourage, known as the &quot;Memphis Mafia.&quot; Davis also discussed drug use among the Beatles, emphasizing that all members struggled with substances at various points.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He touched on Presley's relationship with Colonel Tom Parker, his manager, stating Parker &quot;manipulated Elvis&quot; by pushing him into formulaic movies to generate revenue. Parker was both a relentless promoter and a controlling figure, who pressured Elvis into an unsustainable schedule, such as &quot;800 performances at the Hilton Hotel&quot; over his career, Davis continued. Additionally, there was also the enabling behavior of Elvis' entourage, with none of them urging Elvis to take better care of himself, for fear of getting on his bad side.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, \u003ca href=\"http://www.theaveburyexperience.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Maria Wheatley\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cu>,\u003c/u> a master dowser and researcher of ancient sites, delved into Stonehenge and the site's purported healing properties, as well as the elongated skull people. She challenged the conventional dating of Stonehenge to 2500 BC, arguing that carbon dating evidence suggests it could be as old as 8000 BC. Wheatley emphasized Stonehenge's role beyond a mere calendar, proposing it functioned as a &quot;healing temple&quot; aligned with Earth energies and sound frequencies. She described a particular stone with a hole that &quot;miraculously&quot; filled with water even during droughts, used by ancient visitors for healing ailments. According to her research, the magnetic properties of the stones and their placement on Earth's energy lines emit &quot;infrasound and ultrasound&quot; frequencies conducive to healing and can even possibly repair damaged DNA.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Wheatley concluded that the knowledge of Stonehenge's powers was not lost but &quot;repressed,&quot; passed down through Druids, the Knights Templar, and secret societies, persisting in sacred architecture and spiritual traditions. She described Stonehenge as a site that &quot;alters our state of consciousness,&quot; opening the &quot;third eye&quot; and facilitating psychic experiences.

I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Holdings, who has collaborated extensively with researcher Steve Quayle on documentaries and books, highlighted the growing concern over data tracking and artificial intelligence. &quot;They are tracking everything we do, and people don't understand that with the development of AI, they have the ability now to sort through all of that data,&quot; he explained. Further, he referenced emerging technologies such as the development of small brains for medical research, and synthetic humans funded by the World Economic Forum, questioning the ethical implications behind these projects.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Turning to his personal journey, Holdings described himself as a Christian of over 40 years who explores &quot;some really strange stuff,&quot; including UFOs, which he claims to have witnessed. He believes some ancient texts and Renaissance artwork are references to UFOs, associating these with a broader spiritual framework grounded in the Bible. He described recent scientific experiments, such as those involving the Casimir effect, as evidence of a quantum realm that could be synonymous with the supernatural. &quot;We are dabbling in areas which people don't understand,&quot; he remarked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Addressing contemporary violence, Holdings suggested a spiritual cause behind mass shootings and societal unrest. He recounted a vision of &quot;portals... in the sky and on the ground&quot; releasing demons that influence human behavior, framing current events as signs of the biblical &quot;end of the age.&quot; Citing tech leaders like Peter Thiel, who question whether AI could be linked to the Antichrist system described in biblical prophecy, Holdings connected AI and digital currencies to the biblical &quot;mark of the beast,&quot; with their surveillance and control capabilities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, actor, director, and producer \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jane\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Thomas Jane\u003c/u>\u003c/a> spoke about ufology and an alien presence. He revealed that in 2011, he experienced an event with what he described as &quot;some sort of non-human intelligence&quot; that profoundly altered his worldview. He is currently finishing a book titled &quot;A Human's Guide to Visiting Aliens,&quot; which reflects on his 15-year journey since the experience. On the topic of UFO crashes, including the famous 1947 Roswell incident, he suggested that crashed craft may be piloted by drones or &quot;biological androids,&quot; not the aliens themselves.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the evolution of ufology, Jane noted the increasing involvement of academics and scientists, and how the field is becoming more mainstream and rigorous. He cited the work of researcher Jacques Vallée, who proposed that UFO phenomena might represent an &quot;alien control system&quot; — a cybernetic feedback mechanism influencing human consciousness and beliefs rather than a more direct extraterrestrial interaction. Jane added that he is open to the idea that these entities may originate from other dimensions rather than distant planets.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also touched on advanced technologies related to anti-gravity and zero-point energy, suggesting they represent a possible &quot;gateway&quot; to other worlds inhabited by advanced intelligences. He posited that these technologies are part of an evolutionary ladder that intelligent species eventually unlock, potentially allowing travel between dimensions or times. Jane speculated that some visitors may be future humans or civilizations returning to our time, emphasizing the role of &quot;consciousness&quot; as a form of inner travel.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the last half-hour, George featured an excerpt from a past interview with \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/mcguire-paul-57674/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul McGuire\u003c/a> about prophecy.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mikebara.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mike Bara\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Between-Veil-Things-Unseen-Chronicles/dp/1517721121/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Between The Veil: The Things Unseen\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/As-Darkness-Falls-Things-Chronicles/dp/1532859619/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">As The Darkness Falls: Things Are Not As They Seem\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Days-Belly-Beast-Crossed-Chronicles/dp/1518646859/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">3 Days In The Belly Of The Beast\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09S2274RD/ctoc/?trackAsin=B09S2274RD"},{"artist":"Van Halen","title":"I’ll Wait","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00UP0W25Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00UP0W25Q"},{"artist":"ZZ Top","title":"Legs","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DZTNSLWQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DZTNSLWQ"},{"artist":"Tom Petty","title":"Learning To Fly","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZV6NE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZV6NE"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"Stardust","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00KURQBPQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Survivor","title":"Eye Of The Tiger","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013832A8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0013832A8"},{"artist":"Kenny Rogers","title":"Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000T1DKMK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000T1DKMK"},{"artist":"Apollo 100","title":"Joy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B086WWD31B/ctoc/?trackAsin=B086WWD31B"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday On My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0F25CG51F/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0F25CG51F"},{"artist":"Yes","title":"Owner Of A Lonely Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122UIOI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122UIOI"},{"artist":"Petula Clark","title":"Kiss Me Goodbye","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DZWZDFX1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DZWZDFX1"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"Strange Magic","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136NNQ8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136NNQ8"},{"artist":"Steppenwolf","title":"Magic Carpet Ride","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1VFA6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W1VFA6"},{"artist":"Soundgarden","title":"Black Hole Sun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00J0L7XA0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00J0L7XA0"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKJWG6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKJWG6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e588941d015b2412607c692","%2F6699a07e47174de9bd7236f3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/prophecy","keywords/AI","keywords/supernatural","keywords/alien control system"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/689b1c82854eb8cd15a3241e","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 11 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/689b1c92854eb8cd15a3241f","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 11 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/689b1c9f854eb8cd15a32420","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 11 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/689b1cae854eb8cd15a32421","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Aug 11 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A futuristic abstract image featuring translucent blue spheres on a textured, metallic surface, with a mix of light and shadow creating a sense of depth and dimension.","id":"%2F689544451e00845eeb1b6e01","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/689544451e00845eeb1b6e01","source_credit":"oxygen / Moment / Getty Images","title":"Abstract Blue Spheres on Textured Metallic Surface.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Zimmerman began by reflecting on the astronauts of the 1960s, emphasizing their extraordinary determination rather than mythic heroism. He noted, &quot;They are, in many ways, very ordinary... The only thing different about the astronauts... was two things. One, commitment... The other thing is talent.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Zimmerman praised the innovation of modern private companies that now offer commercial flights. &quot;We want a chaotic, competitive, free industry... That's why we won the space race,&quot; he argued. He praised SpaceX's achievements, such as the reusable Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft, calling their rapid test flights and innovations &quot;unbelievably incredible.&quot; Zimmerman explained Elon Musk's vision for Mars colonization as &quot;totally realistic&quot; from a human adaptability standpoint, though he cautioned Musk's timelines may be optimistic. However, he was critical of NASA's Artemis program, expressing concern over safety risks, particularly with the Orion capsule's heat shield: &quot;That... is Columbia and Challenger all over again... They are willing to risk astronaut lives.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then switched to ethical concerns about space exploration. Zimmerman framed the history of slavery in the American colonies as a cautionary tale for future space societies. &quot;We are going to be doing exactly the same thing the British were doing on the east coast of the United States in the 1600s... establishing new society,&quot; he said. Zimmerman warned that without conscious moral choices, space colonization could create even greater inequality among marginalized groups. &quot;If you don't think about the moral component, you're still making a moral choice... You might do some very bad things by not thinking about it,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/daniel-bourke/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Bourke\u003c/a> explored just how common extrasensory experiences really are, across all cultures, eras, and walks of life. His work explores telepathy, precognition, and related paranormal phenomena as fundamental, cross-cultural human occurrences. Bourke's research began with crisis apparitions—experiences where individuals become mysteriously aware of a loved one's death at a distance. This led him to uncover a wide array of similar accounts, from ancient Rome to indigenous cultures worldwide, demonstrating that telepathic and precognitive events are &quot;anything but rare.&quot; He stated, &quot;I was convinced that wherever I looked… I would find these accounts.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Among the most commonly reported phenomena is the Norse concept of the &quot;vardøger&quot;, a premonitory sight or sound signaling the arrival of a visitor. Bourke explained that the vardøger often manifests as hearing footsteps or seeing someone arrive before they physically do, sometimes even with the visitor wearing the same clothing as in the vision. He also described how shamans and medicine men in various cultures actively use trance states to gain information about distant events or visitors.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Bourke reflected on the profound psychological impact such events have: &quot;These are experiences which can very much reorient the individual's entire sense of their place in the cosmos.&quot; The discussion also touched on the role of the dead as messengers in telepathic experiences. He noted that across cultures and eras, &quot;the dead… are offering these same messages.&quot; On the question of whether telepathy and precognition are innate human abilities, Bourke affirmed that the evidence suggests they are, but their manifestation varies by culture and individual.

Brown\u003c/u>\u003c/a> for a discussion on space exploration. Brown emphasized the intrigue surrounding interstellar objects such as the Atlas comet and the earlier discovery of 'Oumuamua, the first confirmed interstellar object observed in our solar system. He explained that these objects travel at extreme speeds due to the gravitational forces they must overcome when leaving their home systems and entering ours. They are scientifically valuable because they form around other stars under different conditions, potentially carrying unique materials or even alien organic matter. While the idea of these objects being alien probes is speculative, Brown noted that it is not entirely implausible. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Brown revealed how he researches these discoveries by contacting the people who first identified them and then expanding to other experts, often uncovering surprising details. He acknowledged that intercepting interstellar objects is technically possible, given past successes in landing on comets and asteroids. Still, the challenge lies in their unpredictable trajectories and the difficulty of launching missions on short notice. Concepts such as keeping spacecraft in Earth's orbit for rapid deployment have been proposed, though they would be expensive. Regarding sending messages or artifacts into space, he supported the idea, arguing that Earth already emits detectable signals and that proactive communication could be advantageous.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Brown spoke about broader space exploration issues, including the plan to build nuclear reactors on the Moon to power long-term missions, noting that solar power is limited by the Moon's two-week-long nights. Nuclear reactors could provide heat for equipment and vehicles in extremely cold conditions. He expressed skepticism that the United States currently leads in lunar exploration, pointing instead to China's disciplined and well-funded program. He suggested America might have been better off focusing on Mars, where it once had a clear advantage, though China has quickly narrowed the gap. Brown highlighted SpaceX's single-minded drive toward Mars and how Elon Musk's various companies, from tunneling to solar power, make strategic sense for building a self-sufficient Martian colony. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half of the program, \u003ca href=\"https://margiekay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Margie Kay\u003c/u>\u003c/a> described her unique form of remote viewing, which she first discovered in the early 1990s while helping locate a kidnapped child. She explained that her process involves following a visualized cord from her body to a target location, allowing her to be present in real time, experience physical sensations, and gather specific details such as street names, license plates, and appearances of people involved. Over the years, she developed the ability to travel back in time during sessions, witnessing events as they occurred. She attributes a significant enhancement of her abilities to an encounter in 1985 with an extraterrestrial named Val Thor, who granted her a tenfold increase in her psychic skills. According to Kay, Val Thor has guided her since childhood, saved her life on multiple occasions, and assigned her a mission to help raise planetary consciousness through teaching, writing, and media projects.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Kay reported on her work investigating haunted locations, UFO phenomena, and extraterrestrial contact. In paranormal research, she emphasized the importance of historical records, proper equipment, and diverse team roles, while criticizing TV ghost hunting shows for antagonizing spirits. She suggested certain locations have energetic fields or portals, sometimes linked to underground water, that allow entities to pass between dimensions. As MUFON's Central Regional Director, Kay talked about UFO contact as a multidimensional phenomenon tied to consciousness, often facilitated through meditation. She said she avoids remote viewing classified or military sites, claiming such places can detect and track remote viewers through technology and psychic monitoring.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Kay, her remote viewing abilities are not limited to Earth; she claimed to have also visited the Moon, Mars, and other planets tied to people's extraterrestrial star families. On Mars, she has observed abandoned and active structures, tunnels, domes with plants, water sources, and even green vegetation growing openly in certain regions. Kay noted she has used her skills to investigate famous and modern mysteries, including the Amelia Earhart disappearance, where she currently perceives Earhart's remains on a remote, uninhabited Pacific island. Kay revealed she considers her remote viewing a form of time travel achieved by stepping into a light body, unconstrained by time or space, and some extraterrestrials may use similar techniques for instantaneous travel across vast distances.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Mission-True-Story-David-Brown/dp/0062655868/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>The Mission: A True Story\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/How-Research-Haunted-House-Investigators/dp/B0DMM27LTT/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>How to Research a Haunted House\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Faith No More","title":"Epic","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122IVQ0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122IVQ0"},{"artist":"Ray Charles","title":"Hit The Road Jack","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B095XKJ2FS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B095XKJ2FS"},{"artist":"Iggy Pop","title":"The Passenger","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B071ZHVSXJ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B071ZHVSXJ"},{"artist":"Tom Petty","title":"You Wreck Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002B3SD6M/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002B3SD6M"},{"artist":"Soundgarden","title":"Dusty","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZWOIU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZWOIU"},{"artist":"Better Than Ezra","title":"Good","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001OGPTWI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001OGPTWI"},{"artist":"Lou Reed","title":"Satellite Of Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00UPGNJMU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00UPGNJMU"},{"artist":"Johnny Cash","title":"I've Been Everywhere","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07PRDFLPT/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07PRDFLPT"},{"artist":"The Belle Stars","title":"Iko Iko","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07Q62H5WP/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07Q62H5WP"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"Whiskey River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003A98ZKK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003A98ZKK"},{"artist":"Billy Preston","title":"Nothing From Nothing","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B018XDYQOQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B018XDYQOQ"},{"artist":"Steve Miller Band","title":"Jet Airliner","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00MBIHRGY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00MBIHRGY"},{"artist":"Elton John","title":"Tiny Dancer","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09XJ3LJ33/ctoc/?trackAsin=B09XJ3LJ33"},{"artist":"The Vogues","title":"Five O'Clock World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CJFDM5CG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CJFDM5CG"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F600a26269ca99ecd1a41753a","%2F6792ed16b43abe3dbffd13bc"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6826ed959549d8cf707b59c6"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Ryan Wrecker"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/NASA","keywords/space exploration","keywords/remote viewing","keywords/hauntings"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/689882eb2a37874cee09b79f","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 9 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/689882fe2a37874cee09b7a0","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 9 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/689883112a37874cee09b7a1","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 9 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/689883222a37874cee09b7a2","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Aug 9 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Following Shot of Astronaut in Space Suit Confidently Walking on Space Planet Surface Towards The Moon.

Karim recounted his unconventional path to becoming a psychiatrist, beginning with intense pressure from his strict Indian parents to pursue medicine from birth. Despite his creative inclinations and passion for performance, he resisted medical school, moving to Austin to pursue music. His parents, convinced he had lost his way, staged an elaborate intervention involving extended family and a hired specialist. Faced with the threat of being completely cut off from his family, Karim reluctantly agreed to attend medical school, ultimately deciding to specialize in psychiatry because he was fascinated with the human mind, personality formation, and psychological transformation.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Once in psychiatry, Karim said he became interested in the interplay between biology, psychology, social influences, and spirituality in shaping identity and behavior. He emphasized that healing is not solely a matter of medication but often requires corrective experiences — life-changing encounters that challenge and replace destructive patterns, such as breaking a cycle of toxic relationships. He discussed how generational trauma, cultural history, and early attachments shape personality, confidence, and risk-taking, with parents sometimes unintentionally imposing their fears and limitations. Karim highlighted that these influences can affect a person's self-concept and determine whether they feel deserving or capable of pursuing opportunities.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Drawing on his experience running a mental health and addiction treatment center, Karim explained how genetic vulnerabilities and neuroadaptation can make recovery far more difficult, whether from substance abuse or unprocessed trauma. He observed that beyond diagnosable mental illness, a growing number of people suffer from a pervasive sense of being uninspired, unexpressed, and unrealized — a condition worsened by overstimulation from technology, social media, and modern cultural pressures. This overstimulation fosters cognitive rigidity, groupthink, fear, and polarization, eroding meaning and mental flexibility. Recognizing these patterns, Karim revealed he left traditional one-on-one practice to address these broader cultural and psychological issues on a larger stage.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Open Lines followed in the latter half of the program. Jimmy from Raleigh, North Carolina, shared that he recently researched a phenomenon called &quot;seeing without eyes,&quot; a technique for training the mind to perceive without relying on vision. He explained that in Indonesia, thousands of blind people have reportedly been taught over decades to navigate daily life independently using this method. Jimmy described how vision works through the eyes, optic nerves, and brain, noting that the brain can be trained to visualize differently, much like learning an instrument. For blind individuals, colors may be perceived as distinct patterns rather than hues, much like the difference between viewing black-and-white versus color TV. He emphasized that these programs use no psychedelics or drugs, and cited examples of people successfully learning the skill, including cases of legally blind individuals gaining visual perception.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Larry in Sacramento reflected on the importance of using the brain to learn in productive and constructive ways. Initially thinking he ignored advertisements, he realized loud or intrusive ads annoy him, making him less likely to purchase the product — a sort of reverse reaction to marketing. He complimented the host and the call screener, then shared his views on psychedelics, expressing a preference for self-reflection and professional guidance from a good psychologist or psychiatrist over drug use. Larry said he is hesitant to use psychedelics, favoring natural thought processes and mindful personal growth instead.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mike from North Carolina recalled reading \u003cem>The Hidden Persuaders\u003c/em> by Vance Packard as a teenager in the early 1960s, an influential book examining the psychological techniques used in advertising across television, print, and radio. Drawing from his later degree in marketing research, Mike explained that the book explored how advertisers employ subconscious cues to influence specific parts of the brain, motivating consumers to buy products or services — a concept still relevant today despite the book's age and possible lack of scientific rigor by modern standards. He noted how advertising often plays on feelings of inadequacy or FOMO (fear of missing out) to drive purchases.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Gary Wright","title":"Dream Weaver","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002FTK8K6/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Bob Welch","title":"Ebony Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0017F5YV2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0017F5YV2"},{"artist":"Boz Scaggs","title":"Lowdown","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CBCX7R8K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CBCX7R8K"},{"artist":"The Doobie Brothers","title":"Black Water","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NGUQD6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NGUQD6"},{"artist":"Fleetwood Mac","title":"Gypsy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0022WEETC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0022WEETC"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Love Is A Battlefield","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD777C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD777C"},{"artist":"Vangelis","title":"Chariots Of Fire","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07N7QRGJX/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Steve Miller","title":"Jet Airliner","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00MBIHRGY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00MBIHRGY"},{"artist":"Eagles","title":"Peaceful Easy Feeling","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00DAKWCCG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00DAKWCCG"},{"artist":"AC/DC","title":"Have A Drink On Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00O6K8JPI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00O6K8JPI"},{"artist":"Yes","title":"I've Seen All Good People","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VVJ2MKH/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VVJ2MKH"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Burnin' For You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137QW56/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137QW56"},{"artist":"38 Special","title":"Caught Up In You","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VRSWV6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Roy Orbison","title":"Only The Lonely","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LRZ4WNM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LRZ4WNM"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F688c088d42dd6a188a5c7fab","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa85e6d71999f70ab1b9d1"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Lisa Garr"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/human mind","keywords/mad genius"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/68972c5624dc3c146ef6dbec","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 8 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/68972c8024dc3c146ef6dbed","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 8 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/68972c9a24dc3c146ef6dbee","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 8 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/68972caa24dc3c146ef6dbef","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Aug 8 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An inner journey from oneself to another.

In the first half, he discussed public health and ways to evaluate medical advice. Reflecting on the pandemic, he acknowledged both successes and failures. &quot;Some of the things we did prevented probably half a million, maybe even a million deaths,&quot; though there were early missteps such as prolonged school closures, which he opposed based on evidence that children were not major spreaders of COVID-19.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Frieden shared his public health formula: &quot;See, believe, create.&quot; This approach involves recognizing invisible health threats through epidemiology, believing change is possible, and collaborating to implement solutions. He illustrated this with his tuberculosis control work in New York City, where identifying and addressing hospital-driven spread of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis led to an 80% reduction in cases and contributed to preventing 30 million deaths worldwide.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On individual health, he stressed six key areas: blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity, diet, sleep, and avoiding toxins. He singled out high blood pressure as the leading global killer, noting that &quot;only half of people with high blood pressure have even minimally well-controlled it.&quot; He urged patients to work with clinicians to maintain optimal blood pressure. Physical activity, Dr. Frieden described as &quot;the closest thing we have to a wonder drug,&quot; advising at least 30 minutes of exercise four days a week, such as through brisk walking. Regarding nutrition, he urged humility in interpreting research, pointing out that much of what is presented as fact online is guesswork, though he did recommend reducing one's sodium and sugar intake.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, documentary filmmaker \u003ca href=\"https://alienperspectivemovie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Dean Alioto\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared insights from his extensive seven-year exploration into UFO and extraterrestrial phenomena. Unlike typical UFO documentaries focusing on human perspectives, he took a novel approach by hypothesizing the alien viewpoint, and engaging such luminaries as physicist Michio Kaku and philosopher Nick Bostrom, creator of the simulation hypothesis. Bostrom suggested aliens possibly created the human race, and that we are living inside a program they developed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Regarding depicting alien perspectives, &quot;the only way to really do that is to interview one of them,&quot; Alioto said. Since direct contact with aliens remains elusive, his film featured astronaut Sian Proctor, who offered a unique viewpoint as an artist who experienced Earth from space. Her reflections on the &quot;overview effect&quot; provided a profound interpretation of seeing our planet from an alien-like vantage point. Filming an experiencer support group, he noted the authenticity and diversity of those affected, including professionals like doctors and Homeland Security supervisors. &quot;I have a pretty good BS meter because I worked on crime shows for 20 years, and it didn't even blip,&quot; he said, affirming his belief that &quot;we are being visited. It's been going on for a long time.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on the possibility that extraterrestrial beings might have been identified as fallen angels and other beings in ancient times. Religious studies professor Diana Pasulka, featured in Alioto's documentary \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0FG7R4JRS/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Life Beyond Earth\u003c/a>, found striking parallels between religious texts and UFO phenomena.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

While unequivocal about Manson's guilt, he questioned the integrity of the trial process, citing mishandled evidence and prosecutorial misconduct. &quot;People need to know about that,&quot; he said, referring to the handling of Linda Kasabian's testimony and other evidence. Kasabian, the prosecution's main witness, was granted complete immunity despite her questionable actions during the murders. She admitted she was outside by the car, heard the screams, saw a man covered in blood, and did nothing to call the police, Shaw noted, emphasizing that without her testimony, Manson's conviction might not have been possible.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Additionally, he criticized the media and political interference during the trial, particularly a nationwide newspaper headline declaring &quot;Nixon Says Manson Guilty&quot; while the jury was still deliberating. &quot;If those kind of things happen, what you do if you're a judge is you call a mistrial,&quot; Shaw argued, suggesting the trial was compromised but continued regardless. The discussion also touched on Manson's influence over his followers, attributed to his charisma and the cultural climate of the era.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Shaw placed the Manson murders in a broader context of injustice during the turbulent 1960s, referencing the deaths of Marilyn Monroe, JFK, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert Kennedy, and Dorothy Kilgallen. These cases shared flawed investigations, such as botched autopsies and ignored evidence, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, paranormal researcher and tour founder \u003ca href=\"https://courtneymcinvale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Courtney McInvale\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed haunted sites, particularly related to the Civil War. A former Department of Justice counterterrorism investigator, she incorporates skills she learned at the FBI Academy and beyond in her historical tours. She pointed to Chickamauga, Georgia, the site of the Civil War's second bloodiest battle, as a focal point for paranormal activity. &quot;A lot of the pain and anguish and fear that comes in a battle is so strong that it permeates into the energy of the earth and the air around it,&quot; creating a lasting imprint, she explained. Among local legends is &quot;Green Eyes,&quot; a mysterious entity said to &quot;swoop over souls.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In her tours, &quot;we walk through time... talk about the dark history, the morbid things, the macabre,&quot; and she mixes in local interviews and personal investigations, aiming to connect historical facts with reported hauntings. She shared a chilling story from Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta, where thousands of unknown soldiers were buried.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

he explained, highlighting how astronomers of the era, notably Percival Lowell, believed Mars harbored intelligent life, inspired by observations of &quot;canals&quot; on the planet, which Lowell theorized were an elaborate irrigation network for a dying civilization. &quot;The theory was based on these incredibly straight, artificial-looking lines on Mars,&quot; but later observations, especially during Mars's close approach in 1909 by astronomer Eugène Michel Antoniadi, revealed these lines were optical illusions-- natural surface features misperceived due to telescope limitations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Baron described Lowell as a pivotal figure who &quot;spent a personal fortune founding his own observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona,&quot; and dedicated his life to studying Mars. While Lowell never claimed Martians visited Earth, he and others hoped to communicate with them through signals or radio waves. While Lowell's canals were not real, his intuition about Mars having once been wet was correct: &quot;We now know that early in its history, Mars was wet and very earth-like,&quot; Baron said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Reflecting on the cultural impact of the Martian myth, he noted the public clung to the idea of Martians as &quot;superior beings... peaceful people&quot; who were watching the Earth during a time of societal unrest and scientific challenges to traditional religion. The conversation also touched on Nikola Tesla's 1899 claim of receiving mysterious radio signals he believed were from Martians, which fueled public excitement. The 1938 &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast by Orson Welles caused real panic partly because &quot;there was still that lingering belief that the Martians existed&quot; among the public, Baron commented.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and teacher \u003ca href=\"https://ascendthefrequencies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>RJ Spina\u003c/u>\u003c/a> delved into the nature of meditation, manifestation, and attention. He challenges conventional views by asserting that meditation is not an act to be learned but an inherent state of the self. He explained, &quot;The self... exists prior to thinking, prior to emoting, prior to the body... we are meditation itself.&quot; According to Spina, modern conditioning has made constant thinking the default, obscuring our natural meditative state, which is simply &quot;the space between thoughts.&quot; He emphasized the transformative power of meditation, linking it to health, being more fully present, and raising one's vibrational frequency.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On manifestation, Spina offered a nuanced perspective: &quot;We manifest based upon who we are and not what we want.&quot; He warned that focusing on wanting only amplifies the frequency of desire, not the fulfillment of it. Instead, emanating the frequency of already being what we desire aligns the external reality accordingly. His new book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Law-Attention-Enlightened-Manifestation-Functionality-ebook/dp/B0F7N5BMCV/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Law of Attention\u003c/a>, explores how focused attention directs energy and shapes reality. &quot;Where your attention goes, your energy flows, and where your energy flows, it grows,&quot; Spina stated. He distinguished this from the Law of Attraction, describing it as a more fundamental principle tied to self-mastery and consciousness expansion.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One intriguing topic concerned his &quot;time travel meditation,&quot; a technique allowing practitioners to transcend space-time and project their awareness to any point in history. &quot;We can rise above space and time... and select where within time and space we want to put our attention,&quot; Spina said, likening it to viewing a maze from above and choosing a path. Addressing mental health, he affirmed meditation's efficacy for reducing anxiety, explaining that detachment from thoughts and emotions reduces their power: &quot;Once we have some detachment... anxiety just starts to go down.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

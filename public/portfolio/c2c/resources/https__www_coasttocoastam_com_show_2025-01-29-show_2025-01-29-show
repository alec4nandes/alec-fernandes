type-html"><div class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, <a href="https://stevegoreham.com/" target="_blank">Steve Goreham</a>, the executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, discussed the rising demand for electric power and the impending &quot;green energy breakdown&quot;. He criticized green energy initiatives, declaring, &quot;the idea that we can stop the oceans from rising if we all drive electric cars or put in solar panels, that's basically modern superstition.&quot;</p>

<p>Goreham argued the allocation of resources to green energy is ineffective, emphasizing that despite nearly $2 trillion spent last year, it's &quot;unlikely to make a measurable effect on global temperatures.&quot; He contended that natural environmental factors rather than human emissions drive climate change.</p>

<p>The discussion also included electric vehicles (EVs), which he described as falling short of projections, particularly in Europe and China. Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.</p>

<p>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said. He pointed out various incidents of battery fires. &quot;The biggest source of fires in New York City right now? E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.</p>

<p>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI. He noted that &quot;data centers are projected to use 20% of all electrical power in the country&quot; within the next decade, and foresees this rise in demand hindering the Green Movement's goal of phasing out coal and gas plants.</p>

<p>------------------</p>

<p>In the second half, <a href="https://www.globalenlightenmentproject.com/" target="_blank">Christopher Macklin</a>, PhD, explored the dangers of emerging artificial intelligence. Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.</p>

<p>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.</p>

<p>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;</p>

<p>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted. He made an impassioned plea for self-awareness, saying that humanity must reclaim its sovereignty while facing unprecedented technological and biological challenges.</p>

the first half, \u003ca href=\"https://stevegoreham.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Goreham\u003c/a>, the executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, discussed the rising demand for electric power and the impending &quot;green energy breakdown&quot;. He criticized green energy initiatives, declaring, &quot;the idea that we can stop the oceans from rising if we all drive electric cars or put in solar panels, that's basically modern superstition.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham argued the allocation of resources to green energy is ineffective, emphasizing that despite nearly $2 trillion spent last year, it's &quot;unlikely to make a measurable effect on global temperatures.&quot; He contended that natural environmental factors rather than human emissions drive climate change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also included electric vehicles (EVs), which he described as falling short of projections, particularly in Europe and China. Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said. He pointed out various incidents of battery fires. &quot;The biggest source of fires in New York City right now? E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI. He noted that &quot;data centers are projected to use 20% of all electrical power in the country&quot; within the next decade, and foresees this rise in demand hindering the Green Movement's goal of phasing out coal and gas plants.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.globalenlightenmentproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Macklin\u003c/a>, PhD, explored the dangers of emerging artificial intelligence. Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted. He made an impassioned plea for self-awareness, saying that humanity must reclaim its sovereignty while facing unprecedented technological and biological challenges.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Michael Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Green-Breakdown-Coming-Renewable-Failure/dp/0982499663/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Green Breakdown: The Coming Renewable Energy Failure\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Green-Box-Sustainable-Development/dp/0982499647/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Outside the Green Box: Rethinking Sustainable Development\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mad-World-Climatism-Mankind-Climate/dp/0982499620/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/History-Truth-Healing-Syndrome-Morgellons/dp/1708103899/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">History, Truth &amp; Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Transcendence-Navigate-Humanitys-Consciousness/dp/1941608027/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Transcendence\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Enigma-Healing-Christopher-Macklin/dp/1941608019/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dissolving the Enigma of Divine Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRMHGYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XRMHGYY"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMZHBC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMZHBC"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Till There Was You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FT64CS9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FT64CS9"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LVB6PN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LVB6PN"},{"artist":"Eagles","title":"Lyin' Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VVJRFNB/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VVJRFNB"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K6V4I00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K6V4I00"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TR9Q08Q/ctoc?trackAsin=B00TR9Q08Q"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZX8FK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZX8FK"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me to the River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"T.N.T.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said.

E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI.

Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He criticized green energy initiatives, declaring, &quot;the idea that we can stop the oceans from rising if we all drive electric cars or put in solar panels, that's basically modern superstition.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham argued the allocation of resources to green energy is ineffective, emphasizing that despite nearly $2 trillion spent last year, it's &quot;unlikely to make a measurable effect on global temperatures.&quot; He contended that natural environmental factors rather than human emissions drive climate change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also included electric vehicles (EVs), which he described as falling short of projections, particularly in Europe and China. Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said. He pointed out various incidents of battery fires. &quot;The biggest source of fires in New York City right now? E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI. He noted that &quot;data centers are projected to use 20% of all electrical power in the country&quot; within the next decade, and foresees this rise in demand hindering the Green Movement's goal of phasing out coal and gas plants.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.globalenlightenmentproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Macklin\u003c/a>, PhD, explored the dangers of emerging artificial intelligence. Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted. He made an impassioned plea for self-awareness, saying that humanity must reclaim its sovereignty while facing unprecedented technological and biological challenges.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Michael Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Green-Breakdown-Coming-Renewable-Failure/dp/0982499663/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Green Breakdown: The Coming Renewable Energy Failure\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Green-Box-Sustainable-Development/dp/0982499647/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Outside the Green Box: Rethinking Sustainable Development\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mad-World-Climatism-Mankind-Climate/dp/0982499620/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/History-Truth-Healing-Syndrome-Morgellons/dp/1708103899/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">History, Truth &amp; Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Transcendence-Navigate-Humanitys-Consciousness/dp/1941608027/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Transcendence\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Enigma-Healing-Christopher-Macklin/dp/1941608019/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dissolving the Enigma of Divine Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRMHGYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XRMHGYY"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMZHBC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMZHBC"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Till There Was You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FT64CS9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FT64CS9"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LVB6PN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LVB6PN"},{"artist":"Eagles","title":"Lyin' Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VVJRFNB/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VVJRFNB"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K6V4I00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K6V4I00"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TR9Q08Q/ctoc?trackAsin=B00TR9Q08Q"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZX8FK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZX8FK"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me to the River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"T.N.T.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Anna Paulina Luna that plans to investigate UAP cases, as well as Jeffrey Epstein, the JFK assassination, and more. He believes this new panel will lack the necessary resources and authority (such as subpoena power) to probe these mysteries, and that Rep. Luna's focus appears to be shifting towards a JFK hearing rather than UAP investigations. Further, he expressed frustration surrounding the handling of whistleblower David Grusch, who testified about recovered craft and reverse engineering but has not been able to share more due to classified settings. &quot;It's preposterous... they can't get him in a skiff,&quot; he said, shedding light on the bureaucratic hurdles that hinder progress.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, investigator and author \u003ca href=\"http://www.aerops.site/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Lang\u003c/a> revealed details about his years working with BAASS, a private aerospace company that conducted a secretive UFO-related investigation for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), along with the study of psychic powers. He touched on the criteria that made certain cases stand out, particularly those related to propulsion anomalies. &quot;If you had an event where something landed or caused electronic disturbances, that would catch our attention,&quot; he explained. Lang described notable encounters, including one where a UFO disabled a car's electronics. He detailed the &quot;six-layer model for anomalous phenomena,&quot; which included psychic effects related to UFO encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Many witnesses reported &quot;that somehow they felt this craft or this object, could anticipate their thoughts, or could hear what they're thinking,&quot; he said, underscoring a mysterious link between human consciousness or telepathy and UFO activity. Speaking of abduction cases, he noted that while injuries have occurred, they often result from accidental exposure to electromagnetic radiation rather than malicious intent. The conversation further explored a possible connection to UFO phenomena and poltergeist-like activity, with Lang acknowledging the potential for &quot;shadow figures&quot; and strange occurrences in the aftermath of such experiences.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said.

E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI.

Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, \u003ca href=\"https://stevegoreham.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Goreham\u003c/a>, the executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, discussed the rising demand for electric power and the impending &quot;green energy breakdown&quot;. He criticized green energy initiatives, declaring, &quot;the idea that we can stop the oceans from rising if we all drive electric cars or put in solar panels, that's basically modern superstition.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham argued the allocation of resources to green energy is ineffective, emphasizing that despite nearly $2 trillion spent last year, it's &quot;unlikely to make a measurable effect on global temperatures.&quot; He contended that natural environmental factors rather than human emissions drive climate change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also included electric vehicles (EVs), which he described as falling short of projections, particularly in Europe and China. Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said. He pointed out various incidents of battery fires. &quot;The biggest source of fires in New York City right now? E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI. He noted that &quot;data centers are projected to use 20% of all electrical power in the country&quot; within the next decade, and foresees this rise in demand hindering the Green Movement's goal of phasing out coal and gas plants.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.globalenlightenmentproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Macklin\u003c/a>, PhD, explored the dangers of emerging artificial intelligence. Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted. He made an impassioned plea for self-awareness, saying that humanity must reclaim its sovereignty while facing unprecedented technological and biological challenges.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Michael Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Green-Breakdown-Coming-Renewable-Failure/dp/0982499663/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Green Breakdown: The Coming Renewable Energy Failure\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Green-Box-Sustainable-Development/dp/0982499647/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Outside the Green Box: Rethinking Sustainable Development\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mad-World-Climatism-Mankind-Climate/dp/0982499620/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/History-Truth-Healing-Syndrome-Morgellons/dp/1708103899/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">History, Truth &amp; Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Transcendence-Navigate-Humanitys-Consciousness/dp/1941608027/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Transcendence\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Enigma-Healing-Christopher-Macklin/dp/1941608019/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dissolving the Enigma of Divine Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRMHGYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XRMHGYY"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMZHBC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMZHBC"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Till There Was You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FT64CS9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FT64CS9"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LVB6PN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LVB6PN"},{"artist":"Eagles","title":"Lyin' Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VVJRFNB/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VVJRFNB"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K6V4I00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K6V4I00"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TR9Q08Q/ctoc?trackAsin=B00TR9Q08Q"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZX8FK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZX8FK"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me to the River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"T.N.T.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

the first half, \u003ca href=\"https://stevegoreham.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Goreham\u003c/a>, the executive director of the Climate Science Coalition of America, discussed the rising demand for electric power and the impending &quot;green energy breakdown&quot;. He criticized green energy initiatives, declaring, &quot;the idea that we can stop the oceans from rising if we all drive electric cars or put in solar panels, that's basically modern superstition.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham argued the allocation of resources to green energy is ineffective, emphasizing that despite nearly $2 trillion spent last year, it's &quot;unlikely to make a measurable effect on global temperatures.&quot; He contended that natural environmental factors rather than human emissions drive climate change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also included electric vehicles (EVs), which he described as falling short of projections, particularly in Europe and China. Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said. He pointed out various incidents of battery fires. &quot;The biggest source of fires in New York City right now? E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI. He noted that &quot;data centers are projected to use 20% of all electrical power in the country&quot; within the next decade, and foresees this rise in demand hindering the Green Movement's goal of phasing out coal and gas plants.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.globalenlightenmentproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Macklin\u003c/a>, PhD, explored the dangers of emerging artificial intelligence. Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted. He made an impassioned plea for self-awareness, saying that humanity must reclaim its sovereignty while facing unprecedented technological and biological challenges.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Michael Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Green-Breakdown-Coming-Renewable-Failure/dp/0982499663/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Green Breakdown: The Coming Renewable Energy Failure\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Green-Box-Sustainable-Development/dp/0982499647/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Outside the Green Box: Rethinking Sustainable Development\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mad-World-Climatism-Mankind-Climate/dp/0982499620/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/History-Truth-Healing-Syndrome-Morgellons/dp/1708103899/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">History, Truth &amp; Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Transcendence-Navigate-Humanitys-Consciousness/dp/1941608027/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Transcendence\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Enigma-Healing-Christopher-Macklin/dp/1941608019/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dissolving the Enigma of Divine Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRMHGYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XRMHGYY"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMZHBC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMZHBC"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Till There Was You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FT64CS9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FT64CS9"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LVB6PN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LVB6PN"},{"artist":"Eagles","title":"Lyin' Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VVJRFNB/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VVJRFNB"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K6V4I00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K6V4I00"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TR9Q08Q/ctoc?trackAsin=B00TR9Q08Q"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZX8FK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZX8FK"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me to the River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"T.N.T.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He criticized green energy initiatives, declaring, &quot;the idea that we can stop the oceans from rising if we all drive electric cars or put in solar panels, that's basically modern superstition.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham argued the allocation of resources to green energy is ineffective, emphasizing that despite nearly $2 trillion spent last year, it's &quot;unlikely to make a measurable effect on global temperatures.&quot; He contended that natural environmental factors rather than human emissions drive climate change.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also included electric vehicles (EVs), which he described as falling short of projections, particularly in Europe and China. Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said. He pointed out various incidents of battery fires. &quot;The biggest source of fires in New York City right now? E-bike battery fires,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham predicts a shift towards natural gas as demand for electricity escalates due to emerging technologies, such as AI. He noted that &quot;data centers are projected to use 20% of all electrical power in the country&quot; within the next decade, and foresees this rise in demand hindering the Green Movement's goal of phasing out coal and gas plants.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://www.globalenlightenmentproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Christopher Macklin\u003c/a>, PhD, explored the dangers of emerging artificial intelligence. Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted. He made an impassioned plea for self-awareness, saying that humanity must reclaim its sovereignty while facing unprecedented technological and biological challenges.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Michael Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Green-Breakdown-Coming-Renewable-Failure/dp/0982499663/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Green Breakdown: The Coming Renewable Energy Failure\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Outside-Green-Box-Sustainable-Development/dp/0982499647/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Outside the Green Box: Rethinking Sustainable Development\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mad-World-Climatism-Mankind-Climate/dp/0982499620/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/History-Truth-Healing-Syndrome-Morgellons/dp/1708103899/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">History, Truth &amp; Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Transcendence-Navigate-Humanitys-Consciousness/dp/1941608027/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Transcendence\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dissolving-Enigma-Healing-Christopher-Macklin/dp/1941608019/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dissolving the Enigma of Divine Healing\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XRMHGYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XRMHGYY"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMZHBC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMZHBC"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Till There Was You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FT64CS9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FT64CS9"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LVB6PN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LVB6PN"},{"artist":"Eagles","title":"Lyin' Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VVJRFNB/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07VVJRFNB"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K6V4I00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K6V4I00"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Rebel Rebel","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TR9Q08Q/ctoc?trackAsin=B00TR9Q08Q"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZX8FK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZX8FK"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me to the River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"T.N.T.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Goreham claimed, &quot;EV pickup trucks have been a failure... [they're] only 1% share of the US auto market.&quot; He also highlighted challenges in the EV industry as sales have declined and tax incentives have been threatened under Trump's new policies.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Goreham then warned of the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. &quot;We have a worldwide lithium fire epidemic,&quot; he said.

Overall, Macklin is skeptical of AI and sees the technology as ethically flawed. &quot;I've got a lot of red flags with AI... I certainly don't want a chip sewn in my brain,&quot; he stated. He highlighted concerns over the tech's ability to adapt and learn from the internet, and questioned the intentions of its creators. &quot;It depends who wrote it and who's training it,&quot; he shared.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin then moved onto the topic of CRISPR technology, explaining its role in altering genetics and the associated health risks. He warned that such modifications, covertly controlled by AI, could lead to a disconnection between the soul and body. &quot;What happens is the DNA is altered, and then the DNA and the soul is not compatible in the body,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also claimed this could lead to various health crises. &quot;Lyme disease [and other diseases]... they were actually designed,&quot; Macklin said. &quot;I think they want to overtake the body with these particles, which are small—10 to the minus 9—AI bots.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Macklin urged listeners to awaken to their own power in a world rife with manipulation. &quot;The power's within us, it's not within politicians and religious people,&quot; he asserted.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Further, he expressed frustration surrounding the handling of whistleblower David Grusch, who testified about recovered craft and reverse engineering but has not been able to share more due to classified settings. &quot;It's preposterous... they can't get him in a skiff,&quot; he said, shedding light on the bureaucratic hurdles that hinder progress.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, investigator and author \u003ca href=\"http://www.aerops.site/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Lang\u003c/a> revealed details about his years working with BAASS, a private aerospace company that conducted a secretive UFO-related investigation for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), along with the study of psychic powers. He touched on the criteria that made certain cases stand out, particularly those related to propulsion anomalies. &quot;If you had an event where something landed or caused electronic disturbances, that would catch our attention,&quot; he explained. Lang described notable encounters, including one where a UFO disabled a car's electronics. He detailed the &quot;six-layer model for anomalous phenomena,&quot; which included psychic effects related to UFO encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Many witnesses reported &quot;that somehow they felt this craft or this object, could anticipate their thoughts, or could hear what they're thinking,&quot; he said, underscoring a mysterious link between human consciousness or telepathy and UFO activity.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren. He served nine years in the U.S. Naval Reserve.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"/pages/about\">About Coast to Coast AM\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"/calendar/\">George's Calendar\u003c/a>\u003c/p>"}]},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["coast to coast am","radio","ufos","creatures","extraterrestrial","supernatural","myths","legends","monsters","space","universe","science","mystery","sci-fi","george noory","ian punnett","george knapp","art bell","somewhere in time"]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"new_assets","caption":"","id":"%2F5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","source_credit":"","title":"George Noory","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","use_caption":false}},"primary_video":{"type":"embed","value":{"attributes":{"author_name":"","author_url":"","height":0,"thumbnail_height":0,"thumbnail_url":"","thumbnail_width":0,"title":"","width":0},"embed_type":"","html":"","provider":"","rendering_hint":"","url":""}},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"george-noory"},"source":{"type":"plain","value":" "},"source_url":{"type":"plain","value":""},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Coast to Coast AM Radio\u003c/p>\n\n"},"title":{"type":"title","value":"George Noory"}},"ingestion":{"external_url":"","feed_content_id":"/content/george-noory","feed_partner_content":false,"feed_permalink":"https:/www.coasttocoastam.com/page/george-noory","feed_type":"","feed_vendor":"C2C"},"summary":{"author":"Coast to Coast AM Staff","description":"Coast to Coast AM Radio","image":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"caption":"","link":"","new_tab":false,"source_credit":"","title":"George Noory","url":"asset://new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3","use_caption":false},"keywords":["coast to coast am","radio","ufos","creatures","extraterrestrial","supernatural","myths","legends","monsters","space","universe","science","mystery","sci-fi","george noory","ian punnett","george knapp","art bell","somewhere in time"],"primary_slug":"george-noory","slugs":["george-noory"],"sponsored":false,"title":"George Noory"},"targeting":{"exclusion":{"tags":[]},"publish_date":1580474700000,"publish_end_date":4115978604802,"publish_origin":"brands/COAST-PR (15194)","syndication":{"publish_origin":"brands/COAST-PR (15194)","refs":{}},"targets":[{"id":"WlGey","operator":"OR","readonly":false,"remove":false,"update":false,"what":["coast-categories/host-george-noory"],"where":["collections/Coast to Coast AM","brands/COAST-PR (15194)","collections/Coast to Coast AM Host"],"workflow":""}]}},"pub_start":1580474700000,"type":"content:coast-to-coast-article","summary":{"title":"George Noory","description":"Coast to Coast AM Radio","image":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5e381ddba201ec1fa69d0ce3"}}]}}],"lookup":["publish_origin:brands/COAST-PR (15194)","id:/67aeabacf126102594e60db1","slug:2025-02-19-show","slug:2025-02-19-show","keyword:keywords/regenerative medicine","keyword:keywords/abundance"]}},{"id":"%2F67aea968f126102594e60d98","type":"PUBLISHING","record":{"ref_id":"%2F67aea968f126102594e60d98","type":"content:coast-to-coast-show","payload":{"canonical_url":"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2025-02-18-show/","cuser":"user/ldap/PREBUR1SXN","fields":{"articles":{"type":"html","value":""},"author":{"type":"author","value":[]},"blocks":{"type":"flex","value":[{"locale":{"locales":[]},"schedule":{"begin":0,"enabled":false,"end":0},"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>First Half: Author \u003ca href=\"https://charlesbosworthbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Bosworth\u003c/a> presents the latest into the investigation of the death of six-year-old JonBenet Ramsey that occurred at her home in Boulder, Colorado, in December 1996.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

hour guest, journalist \u003ca href=\"https://jeffersonmorley.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jefferson Morley\u003c/a> joined George Knapp to discuss a trove of &quot;newly discovered&quot; FBI files related to the JFK assassination and what surprises might be hidden in those pages. He expressed cautious optimism about the release of these 2,400 pages, stating, &quot;The government's reaction is often to cover up, but in this case, they discovered assassination-related records and said, 'Here they are.'&quot; The documents, he suggested, could illuminate the convoluted relationships between the FBI, CIA, and Lee Harvey Oswald in the months leading up to the assassination, challenging the official narrative that Oswald acted alone. Morley highlighted possible files of interest, particularly one related to an undercover CIA officer, George Joannides, who surveilled Oswald in 1963. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second hour, Washington DC reporter \u003ca href=\"https://www.askapoluaps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Laslo\u003c/a> provided insider details and analysis about a proposed new \u003ca href=\"https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2025/02/11/comer-luna-republicans-ufos-jfk-mlk-epstein-task-force\" target=\"_blank\">congressional panel\u003c/a> led by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna that plans to investigate UAP cases, as well as Jeffrey Epstein, the JFK assassination, and more. He believes this new panel will lack the necessary resources and authority (such as subpoena power) to probe these mysteries, and that Rep. Luna's focus appears to be shifting towards a JFK hearing rather than UAP investigations. Further, he expressed frustration surrounding the handling of whistleblower David Grusch, who testified about recovered craft and reverse engineering but has not been able to share more due to classified settings. &quot;It's preposterous... they can't get him in a skiff,&quot; he said, shedding light on the bureaucratic hurdles that hinder progress.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, investigator and author \u003ca href=\"http://www.aerops.site/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Lang\u003c/a> revealed details about his years working with BAASS, a private aerospace company that conducted a secretive UFO-related investigation for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), along with the study of psychic powers. He touched on the criteria that made certain cases stand out, particularly those related to propulsion anomalies. &quot;If you had an event where something landed or caused electronic disturbances, that would catch our attention,&quot; he explained. Lang described notable encounters, including one where a UFO disabled a car's electronics. He detailed the &quot;six-layer model for anomalous phenomena,&quot; which included psychic effects related to UFO encounters.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Many witnesses reported &quot;that somehow they felt this craft or this object, could anticipate their thoughts, or could hear what they're thinking,&quot; he said, underscoring a mysterious link between human consciousness or telepathy and UFO activity. Speaking of abduction cases, he noted that while injuries have occurred, they often result from accidental exposure to electromagnetic radiation rather than malicious intent.

Arimilli explained her work as helping individuals uncover and address the root causes of recurring life challenges, whether in relationships, health, or finances, by guiding them to rediscover their inner power as healers and creators. She emphasized that people often get stuck because they place their power outside themselves, believing external factors or others are responsible for their dissatisfaction. To break free, individuals must courageously reclaim their power and recognize their ability to create change, she revealed. Arimilli framed this process as a journey of healing that reaches from the cellular to the soul level, empowering people to shift patterns that have kept them stagnant.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Arimilli highlighted that many relationship struggles stem from fear-based actions rather than true love. She explained that fear—whether of conflict, rejection, or hurting a partner—can manifest as avoidance or inauthentic behavior, which disconnects individuals from their true selves and their partners. Love, by contrast, requires authentic and courageous actions that generate positive energy, such as oxytocin, the &quot;love hormone.&quot; She likened the process of building healthy relationships to the concept of &quot;noble gases&quot; in science: two balanced, self-sustained individuals who come together to amplify each other's strengths. She emphasized the importance of inner work and self-love in achieving this balance, explaining that self-love allows people to transform their frequency and attract healthier relationships.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>According to Arimilli, self-love is not indulgent but transformative and essential for personal growth. It involves setting boundaries, prioritizing oneself, and being authentic in actions and emotions. She described how her journey, including challenges like cancer, taught her the necessity of self-love for healing and fulfillment. By shifting from people-pleasing and perfectionism to self-care and authenticity, individuals can change their energy and create new opportunities not only in relationships but also in their careers and overall well-being. True self-love fosters alignment with one's soul and enables profound healing, growth, and success across all areas of life, she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half of the program, communication and relationship expert \u003ca href=\"https://www.marsvenus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. John Gray\u003c/a> delved into the biological and cultural differences between men and women, emphasizing their importance in fostering healthier relationships. He highlighted how biology profoundly impacts behavior, stressing that traditional gender roles and hormonal differences are deeply ingrained. According to Gray, modern culture often tries to neutralize these distinctions, leading to confusion in personal identities, particularly among younger generations. He explained how men and women interact differently under stress: men benefit from activities that increase testosterone, while women need an emotional connection to stimulate estrogen. He also criticized societal trends that weaken these natural dynamics, such as the absence of fathers and the increasing stress on women in the workplace.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Gray elaborated on how stress hormones influence behavior, particularly within relationships. He described how women's need to vent and share feelings arises from a biological need to lower stress through emotional connection, whereas men's instinct to solve problems comes from their drive to produce testosterone. He advised men to practice empathy and validation rather than immediately offering solutions, as this approach helps reduce women's stress and strengthens the relationship. He also pointed out that modern working women, who often operate in testosterone-driven environments, need support from their partners to reconnect with their &quot;feminine side&quot; to balance their hormones and reduce stress.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Gray discussed the importance of maintaining polarity in relationships by nurturing the biological roles of men and women. He highlighted how men thrive on feeling needed and trusted, which boosts testosterone, while women feel more connected when their emotional needs are met, boosting estrogen. He emphasized the role of monogamy in maintaining attraction and the dangers of behaviors like pornography or infidelity, which erode the bond. Gray offered practical advice, such as helping women feel heard and validated and encouraging men to manage emotions internally to sustain strong partnerships. Couples can achieve greater harmony and intimacy by understanding and respecting these differences, he noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006016848X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Conscious-Men-Practical-Qualities-Masculinity/dp/1890909319/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Conscious Men\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Mars-Venus-Relationship-Complex/dp/1953295134/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond Mars and Venus: Relationship Skills for Today's Complex World\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"INXS","title":"This Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DVN2L9FS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DVN2L9FS"},{"artist":"Jellyfish","title":"Baby's Coming Back","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003WNZ02A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003WNZ02A"},{"artist":"Mr. Mister","title":"Broken Wings","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004LGKM48/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004LGKM48"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Ship Of Fools","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122RQX4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122RQX4"},{"artist":"The Rolling Stones","title":"Almost Hear You Sigh","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002KV8P0O/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002KV8P0O"},{"artist":"Sheryl Crow","title":"Strong Enough","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W022U4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W022U4"},{"artist":"Talk Talk","title":"It's My Life","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00184R9EW/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Steve Winwood","title":"Higher Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07MQVJX9B/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Paul Westerberg","title":"Dyslexic Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00123G28I/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00123G28I"},{"artist":"Roxy Music","title":"Love Is The Drug","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SXHGOM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SXHGOM"},{"artist":"Rihanna","title":"Love On The Brain","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073RZHL1X/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073RZHL1X"},{"artist":"Al Green","title":"Let's Stay Together","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00UMIKJ6U/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Niall Horan","title":"Slow Hands","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B075QPDZ14/ctoc/?trackAsin=B075QPDZ14"},{"artist":"Alphaville","title":"Forever Young","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001202N02/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66b552c3cece0aa51557f2b1","%2F5e000beccc137bf2442015f5"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/energy healing","keywords/relationships","keywords/gender issues"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b1d822b5fc33fa0a9021f5","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Feb 15 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b1d852b5fc33fa0a9021f6","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Feb 15 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b1d867b5fc33fa0a9021f7","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Feb 15 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b1d877b5fc33fa0a9021f8","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Feb 15 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A portal to the metaverse, new energy, a journey into the future.

Honigman provided a detailed explanation of astrology, describing it as an ancient practice once considered a science but now classified as a pseudoscience. It involves studying the movement and positions of planets to interpret their impact on personality, behavior, and life events. She emphasized that astrology goes beyond sun signs, analyzing an intricate natal chart that considers the alignment of all planets at the time of birth. According to Honigman, this chart can indicate personality traits, tendencies, and even life events like engagements or career paths.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She touched on how upbringing interacts with astrological traits, using her experience as a Pisces raised in a family of earth signs. Despite her family's pragmatic nature, her natural Pisces tendencies, such as emotionality and interest in ancient cultures, remained dominant, showcasing how astrological traits can guide one's individuality. Honigman described Tarot as her gateway to astrology, explaining that Tarot incorporates astrological elements, including planetary influences on star signs. She explained how she uses Tarot and astrology to provide insights, as Tarot allows for more dynamic interpretations during readings. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Honigman shared her insights about relationships and zodiac compatibility, cautioning against certain combinations, such as Gemini-Gemini, due to their challenging dynamics. She noted how different signs exhibit manipulative tendencies, with Scorpio being secretive and strategic, and Leo craving admiration and control. However, she pointed out that compatibility depends on effort and willingness to collaborate in relationships.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the latter half of the program, \u003ca href=\"https://liu.se/en/employee/freny92\" target=\"_blank\">Fredrik Nyström\u003c/a>, a professor and consultant in internal medicine and endocrinology, challenged traditional health guidelines with findings that emphasize moderation and enjoyment over restrictive lifestyles. In his studies, he found that consuming more calories, even from fast food, led to improved HDL (good cholesterol) levels, debunking the idea that fat is inherently harmful. Instead, he identified sugar as the primary dietary culprit for metabolic issues, observing severe liver enzyme spikes in participants consuming high-sugar diets. Nyström also advocated for embracing pleasures like red wine, arguing that these indulgences contribute to happiness and sustainability, which are key for long-term health.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Nyström is an advocate for less strenuous exercise and recommended activities like walking in natural environments, which promote physical and mental health without the risks associated with extreme workouts. He also supports exposing the body to mild stress, such as cold plunges, to stimulate brown adipose tissue, which boosts metabolism and burns fat. He critiqued rigid health advice, such as eating excessive vegetables and reducing fat, citing studies that show these diets can increase risks of certain health conditions, including heart issues, particularly in women.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Nyström promoted a practical approach to health that aligns with the &quot;obesity paradox,&quot; where being slightly overweight is associated with reduced mortality compared to being lean. Nyström attributed this to the mental toll of constant dieting, suggesting that finding balance in diet, physical activity, and stress management is more important. Based on his research, Nyström advocated for a lifestyle that prioritizes happiness, contentment, and evidence-based moderation.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lighten-load-shoulders-Fredrik-Nystr%C3%B6m/dp/9181012071/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Lighten the load on your shoulders!\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Paul McCartney","title":"Arrow Through Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00A46IP8Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00A46IP8Y"},{"artist":"Peter Gabriel","title":"In Your Eyes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07D1G1M3B/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Timbaland","title":"Apologize","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V64LIA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000V64LIA"},{"artist":"Lenny Kravitz","title":"Let Love Rule","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TETD6O/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Sinead O'Connor","title":"Nothing Compares 2 U","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0B3SH1TPH/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0B3SH1TPH"},{"artist":"Joe Jackson","title":"Be My Number Two","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07H1D8KXX/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07H1D8KXX"},{"artist":"Alice In Chains","title":"No Excuses","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00MHR0R7U/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Icehouse","title":"Crazy","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073T9MJT3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073T9MJT3"},{"artist":"Meat Loaf","title":"Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01G841GNQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Night By Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CCGT6NB9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CCGT6NB9"},{"artist":"Van Halen","title":"Best Of Both Worlds","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00VUOF29Y/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Wallflowers","title":"One Headlight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZV5G2/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Dave Mason","title":"We Just Disagree","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137VHYM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137VHYM"},{"artist":"Yaz","title":"Only You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00124675A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00124675A"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F67ae5f0f38648ca6e094b7cd","%2F67ae5fa738648ca6e094b7dc"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":[]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b07ddc34abc8cf4aca62e2","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Feb 14 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b07dec34abc8cf4aca62e3","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Feb 14 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b07dfc34abc8cf4aca62e4","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Feb 14 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67b07e0c34abc8cf4aca62e5","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Feb 14 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Zodiac signs inside of horoscope circle.

He also looked at the years ahead, including what he anticipates will be a pole shift in 2030, and what to expect. There is a celestial body known as Nemesis, a brown dwarf star that orbits our sun, Masters asserted, and he emphasized that this star is not merely a myth, citing historical data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) that first detected it. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Nibiru is one of three planets in orbit around Nemesis, he continued, as he described the dire implications of this mini-constellation for our solar system. Referring to this mini-constellation as Planet X, he criticized the authorities for withholding information, claiming that they decided in 1983 that we were not to know. Because of the gravitational or astronomical interactions with Nemesis as it moves closer to Earth, Masters has concluded that a pole shift will occur in five years. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;If we had started preparing in 1983, we would have had a 90% chance of survival... Now we have a 10% chance,&quot; he declared, drawing parallels to past historical calamities like the Great Flood. He highlighted the importance of underground shelters, referencing the &quot;Ant People&quot; who were said to save the Hopis in past disasters, and how nations like Sweden and Russia have invested in such preparations. We will have indicators before the 2030 catastrophe, such as a potential asteroid impact that could trigger massive tsunamis along the US East Coast, he warned.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and researcher \u003ca href=\"https://bigfoottimes.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Daniel Perez\u003c/u>\u003c/a> talked about his study of the Patterson-Gimlin film site, and related imagery. The famous Patterson-Gimlin film shot in 1967 in Bluff Creek, CA, is considered by many to be one of the best and clearest images of the enigmatic creature. Perez lamented the loss of the original footage, and explained that while copies exist, the original remains unavailable. In recent years, the footage has been \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVh1PzMOnqo\" target=\"_blank\">digitally stabilized\u003c/a>, and &quot;what you see in that film is a female,&quot; Perez pointed out based on observable breasts. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He compared the scrutiny of the Patterson-Gimlin footage to that of the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination, noting that, &quot;If it really is a man in a costume, then you should be able to duplicate it, and to date, no one has.&quot; Perez also addressed claims by Bob Hieronimus, who alleged he wore a Bigfoot suit during the filming, arguing that the physical evidence and testimonies from that time cast doubt on such claims. Perez introduced his new book, &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/smartbigfoot/posts/9283081871723835/\" target=\"_blank\">Bigfoot at Bluff Creek\u003c/a>,&quot; a comprehensive pictorial exploration of the film and its legacy, available for $39.54 by contacting him at the email address on his \u003ca href=\"https://bigfoottimes.net/\" target=\"_blank\">website\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rather than a paranormal or interdimensional creature, Perez believes Bigfoot is an elusive animal or advanced primate, that possibly migrated to the US from the Bering land bridge. The researcher drew parallels between Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman or Yeti, suggesting that while they may share a common ancestor, their physical descriptions differ. He shared his personal experiences, recalling a moment in 1980 when he found large tracks in Hemet, California, which fueled his curiosity.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.natureoflongevity.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Douglas Mulhall\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHGXS69/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Revelation and Planet X: The Kolbrin Bible Indigo Connection\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S2Y9X64/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Win-Win Survival Handbook\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099BZMYFX/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Surviving the Planet X Tribulation\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://bigfootgiftstoys.com/store/bigfoot-books/bigfoot-encounters-past-to-present-777700001928878\" target=\"_blank\">Bigfoot: Encounters Past to Present\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0XNQS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0XNQS"},{"artist":"The Lettermen","title":"I Have Dreamed","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0C5QLYP1G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0C5QLYP1G"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Europa","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00LP2GNE4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00LP2GNE4"},{"artist":"Golden Earring","title":"Twilight Zone","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0070V6BCI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0070V6BC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LD0YLVE"},{"artist":"Fleetwood Mac","title":"Little Lies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DV1W713P/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DV1W713P"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZX8FK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZX8FK"},{"artist":"Pointer Sisters","title":"I’m So Excited","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06Y6GJZ7Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06Y6GJZ7Q"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDG9LM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Andrea Bocelli","title":"Bésame Mucho","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07KQHS8VF/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07KQHS8VF"},{"artist":"Emerson Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Joe Jackson","title":"Steppin' Out","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07H4WQNVW/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"I Love You...I’ll Kill You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDF2DS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDF2DS"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0D9CF6GF3/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":" Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dffeb1f537fd678a3ece580","%2F5e00f03d537fd678a3ecf0ed"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/Planet X","keywords/preparedness","keywords/Bigfoot","keywords/Patterson-Gimlin"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/67af29ca546ca6a9575f4fc6","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Feb 13 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67af29dd546ca6a9575f4fc7","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Feb 13 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67af29ea546ca6a9575f4fc8","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Feb 13 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67af29fa546ca6a9575f4fc9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Feb 13 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Nomadic Planet, Travelling Freely Throughout The Galaxy.","id":"%2F67a55e57ac4f9f3cf304ab86","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/67a55e57ac4f9f3cf304ab86","source_credit":"Mark Stevenson/UIG / Collection Mix: Subjects / Getty Images","title":"Free Roaming Rogue Planet.","url":"asset://assets.getty/67a55e57ac4f9f3cf304ab86","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1739458800000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2025-02-13-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Preparedness author \u003ca href=\"https://yowusa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Marshall Masters\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed the trajectory of Planet X.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Highlighting the importance of nutrition in reversing health issues, particularly dementia and cardiovascular diseases, he asserted that many ailments stem from nutritional deficiencies rather than genetics. Dr. Wallach shared alarming statistics, revealing that around 800,000 Americans die annually from cardiovascular disease, with one-third under age 65. &quot;We can stop that, reverse that, like almost instantly,&quot; he suggested, using nutritional solutions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on longevity, referencing the advanced age of various biblical figures and the Hunza people of Pakistan, whom he claimed have an average lifespan of 122 years, due to their mineral-rich diet. In his trips to Africa and China, he found that people have different food sources than Americans and are getting more natural minerals through seafood and the water that comes down from their mountains. He pointed out the average lifespan discrepancies across US states, attributing lower lifespans in southern states to poor dietary practices and lack of mineral-rich water. Listeners called in with various health questions, including chronic hives and neuropathy. Dr. Wallach consistently advocated for supplementation, stating, &quot;You cannot get everything you need just by eating well.&quot; \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, \u003ca href=\"https://paradigmresearchgroup.org/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Steve Bassett\u003c/u>\u003c/a>, a prominent advocate for UFO disclosure, expressed optimism that the current administration could be pivotal in revealing the truth about the non-human technological presence on Earth. He stated, &quot;I think the current president is going to be the disclosure president,&quot; suggesting that significant developments could occur within weeks. Bassett emphasized the rapid dismantling of the &quot;truth embargo,&quot; noting &quot;Something is happening almost every few days, every week.&quot; He cited the establishment of a transparency task force in Congress, which he described as &quot;unprecedented&quot; and indicative of a shift towards openness regarding UFOs and other government secrets. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Bassett commented that recent hearings and legislative efforts are laying the groundwork for potential disclosures, with the possibility of whistleblowers coming forward, particularly those with firsthand accounts of UFO encounters related to nuclear incidents. Reflecting on the public's readiness for disclosure, Bassett suggested that younger generations might be more accepting. He believes that the infrastructure for disclosure has already been set up, and the time for confirmation is nearing. Further, he shared a hopeful vision of a post-disclosure world where political divides could lessen, adding that &quot;This is the biggest, most non-partisan issue ever.&quot; He also praised an upcoming documentary titled &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/age-of-disclosure-ufo-documentary-trailer-sxsw-1236114831/\" target=\"_blank\">The Age of Disclosure\u003c/a>,&quot;

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

This has created an &quot;artificial bubble,&quot; he said, warning investors that &quot;stocks are two to three times higher than they would have been without this endless stimulus.&quot; He believes that by 2027 there will be a significant downturn, &quot;as bad as down 88-89% on the S&amp;P 500,&quot; down 94% on the NASDAQ tech stocks, and Bitcoin falling to $30,000. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He cautions that &quot;there's really nowhere to hide&quot; and recommends moving investments into US Treasury bonds and gold, which are &quot;safe havens&quot; that historically perform well during downturns. &quot;You can't have a great boom without a great bust,&quot; he explained, adding, &quot;this is the time to get out of stocks and unnecessary real estate.&quot; Dent believes the forthcoming crash will present a unique opportunity, stating, &quot;You will be able to buy real estate and stocks at the best prices you'll see in your entire lifetime.&quot; After the crash, he recommends investing in tech and emerging country stocks such as India, which can be done through ETFs (exchange-traded funds) like EEM and INDA. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, remote viewer and trainer \u003ca href=\"https://crviewer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Lyn Buchanan\u003c/u>\u003c/a> shared his remarkable journey into the world of psi phenomena and military applications. His entry into military remote viewing began when he was working as an intercept operator in Germany and became angry over an incident, and this caused the computers to blow out. This demonstration of PK (psychokinesis) led to him being transferred to Fort Meade in 1992 to join a remote viewing unit aimed at controlling enemy computers. He reported that the now-discontinued military's psychic program was highly unusual yet effective, leading to successful intelligence operations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Today, Buchanan teaches controlled remote viewing, a structured methodology involving sketching and writing impressions on paper that he believes can harness innate psychic abilities. &quot;Some students are doing a lot better than we ever did in the military,&quot; he revealed, noting that the practice of honing remote viewing skills is not unlike martial arts training. &quot;The viewer is kept totally blind to what the target is,&quot; he explained, emphasizing the importance of maintaining objectivity by preventing any &quot;pollution&quot; of information. He recounted remarkable experiences, including a task where he foresaw the Fukushima disaster days before it occurred and detailed the 9/11 event three years prior, stating, &quot;We had no idea what we were describing.&quot; Regarding remote viewing targets of future events, he shared this thought-provoking idea: &quot;We don't predict the future.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Pointing out the shift in pharmacy practices since her education, she noted that synthetic options have replaced many natural remedies. She expressed concerns over the current state of healthcare and medical education. Many schools have taken out critical classes like biochemistry and boiled teaching down to symptoms, diagnosis, and drugs, she said, and this, in turn, contributes to dissatisfaction among patients about their treatments. Lafferty also shared her personal health choices during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as taking immune-boosting supplements like elderberry, zinc, and vitamins D and C. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She addressed the evolving landscape of natural medicine within the medical community, emphasizing the model of integration with modern practices. &quot;Regular doctors... are beginning to become more aware than they were, let's say, 10 years ago,&quot; she pointed out, highlighting her own experiences presenting on natural anti-inflammatories at her medical school. When discussing diabetes, she explained the risks of micro-damage to blood vessels caused by high sugar levels, which can lead to severe complications. &quot;When those little blood vessels get damaged... they don't get oxygen,&quot; she said, likening it to a lawn that dies without water. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dr. Lafferty urged a return to &quot;regenerative farming&quot; and traditional practices, &quot;We all need the exercise of gardening... moving your body actually decreases arthritis,&quot; she advised.

However, she stressed that astrology should not be viewed as deterministic; rather, it provides a framework for understanding potential outcomes. She noted that the planet Mars has been retrograde (traveling backward) for about the last three weeks. &quot;We had this great forward motion with the Middle East situation... it's not solved, but it's better. So we're at a stop, and when Mars goes direct, then we're going to see how well everything sticks to the plan,&quot; she stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She recommended caution for periods of Mercury retrograde, especially concerning contracts and travel. &quot;Check the reservation once, twice, three times,&quot; she suggested. Stellas also touched on the astrological compatibility of individuals. For her clients, she often compares charts to assess relationships. She also advises them on the best dates to schedule elective surgeries, believing that the various lunar phases can affect outcomes. The strength of planets was discussed, with the personal planets (those closest to the Sun --Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars) being the most influential in our daily life. During the last hour, she gave astrological readings for callers.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Resurfaced \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoUfR3x-2DQ\" target=\"_blank\">leaked military footage\u003c/a> purportedly shows the plane near the Nicobar Islands, accompanied by unidentified orbs. According to Forbes, what we're seeing in the video is the plane getting zapped by orbs created by secret military technology. He further suggested that the orbs may have interacted with the aircraft in a way that defies conventional physics.  \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Forbes speculated on the potential fate of the passengers, pointing to a possible espionage or counter-espionage operation, involving advanced military technology. &quot;I think what we're looking at there is teleportation of a fashion, like superluminal [faster than light] travel,&quot; he proposed. He also delved into the intriguing work of Navy engineer Salvatore Pais, particularly regarding his patents and theories on zero-point energy. &quot;The concept of zero-point energy is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that suggests space is not empty,&quot; Forbes explained, adding that this source could potentially be harnessed for free energy, and may have been what was powering the mysterious orbs he believes interacted with MH370.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, artist and researcher \u003ca href=\"https://thecydoniainstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\">George Haas\u003c/a> spoke about his groundbreaking findings on Martian structures, drawing parallels with ancient Earth civilizations like the Mesoamericans and Egyptians \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/george-haas-martian-anomalies-2925/\" target=\"_blank\">(view related images)\u003c/a>. Haas, who utilizes publicly available NASA images from missions like the Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, highlights a variety of anomalous structures and geoglyphs on Mars' surface that display a high degree of geometric and symbolic design. &quot;Intelligent life on Earth reveals itself through the geometry irregularity of its construction,&quot; and we see similar patterns on the Red Planet, he said, noting pyramids and &quot;star forts.&quot; These formations have precise angles that would be very difficult to create by a natural process like wind or erosion, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He touched on the work of Dr. John Brandenburg, who suggests that evidence of xenon-129 on Mars points to a nuclear explosion, potentially linked to a past civilization. &quot;NASA has known about this since the Viking era,&quot; Haas remarked, indicating that the implications of such findings could rewrite our understanding of Martian history. Delving deeper, he drew connections between Maya texts and Martian history, proposing that the &quot;sixth Earth place&quot; mentioned in their mythology refers to Mars. Haas hypothesized that a catastrophic event may have led to the destruction of a civilization on Mars, which could have been related to an exploding planet in the asteroid belt. He further posited that Martian structures may have been built by a visiting ET species, who used them as outposts to protect against threats to the Earth, which they had also colonized.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Great-Architects-Mars-Evidence-Civilizations/dp/1591435161/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>The Great Architects of Mars: Evidence for the Lost Civilizations on the Red Planet\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583941215/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Cydonia Codex\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Martian-Codex-More-Reflections-Mars/dp/1556438141/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Martian Codex: More Reflections from Mars\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"John Lennon ","title":"Slippin' And Slidin'","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0042UADGU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0042UADGU"},{"artist":"Acantha Lang","title":"He Said/She Said","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0C3MJVDW3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0C3MJVDW3"},{"artist":"Billy Preston","title":"Nothing From Nothing","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B018XDYQOQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B018XDYQOQ"},{"artist":"George McRae","title":"Rock Your Baby","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01FIPX0OE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01FIPX0OE"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Rikki Don't Lose That Number","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZHNVI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZHNVI"},{"artist":"Sheryl Crow","title":"Real Gone","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IEWR67U/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01IEWR67U"},{"artist":"Al Stewart","title":"Year Of The Cat","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122OQ3W/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Five Times August","title":"Jesus, What Happened To Us","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0928DRZW9/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"Give Me Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BV5GZ8CT/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BV5GZ8CT"},{"artist":"Dorothy Moore","title":"Misty Blue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07637XTNH/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Rod Stewart","title":"Gasoline Alley","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V675BA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Bonnie Raitt","title":"Feels Like Home","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002KWHAOK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002KWHAOK"},{"artist":"John Prine","title":"Unlonely","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Missing-Years-John-Prine/dp/B0000005XY"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night (Barking At Airplanes)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07545X5D6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07545X5D6"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F655e76430683f0e1f6c3de4c","%2F5e002231537fd678a3ece843"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/zero point energy","keywords/MH370","keywords/Mars"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/67a9e4be95e222519b55c26d","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Feb 9 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67a9e4cd95e222519b55c26e","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Feb 9 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67a9e4da95e222519b55c26f","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Feb 9 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/67a9e4e895e222519b55c270","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Feb 9 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Teleport traveling in space across the universe. 3D rendering","id":"%2F67a554db85219ab75b2d6790","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/67a554db85219ab75b2d6790","source_credit":"gonin / iStock / Getty Images","title":"Teleport traveling in space across the universe 3D rendering","url":"asset://assets.getty/67a554db85219ab75b2d6790","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1739113200000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2025-02-09-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Citizen journalist \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/@justxashton\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Ashton Forbes\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 and its connection to zero-point energy.

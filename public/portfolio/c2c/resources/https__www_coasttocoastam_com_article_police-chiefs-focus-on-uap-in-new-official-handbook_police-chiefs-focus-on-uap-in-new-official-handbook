In the first half, he shared insights into the state of biodiversity and the pressing need for species documentation, as well as why he believes we have entered the first mass extinction event since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. &quot;We're probably losing something on the order of 20,000 species a year,&quot; he lamented, adding that the loss is exacerbated by human activities, including habitat destruction and pollution. If unaddressed, this could lead to a staggering 80% of Earth's species vanishing within the next 200-300 years.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>With only about 20% of Earth's species identified, Wheeler emphasized the urgency of exploration and taxonomic research: &quot;If we don't pick up the pace, we certainly will lose a lot of species and have no evidence that they ever existed.&quot; Perhaps some ten million species have yet to be identified, and while insects represent about half of the known species, the actual biodiversity, including fungi and other invertebrates, is likely underestimated. He proposed that with a modest investment of $1 billion annually, we could document millions of unnamed species within 50 years, arguing, &quot;The amount of knowledge we would gain... sounds like a bargain to me.&quot; He also expressed some cautious optimism, saying, &quot;I don't think it's too late to slow the rate of extinction&quot; if we adapt our relationship with the environment to ensure a diverse and thriving planet.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half ascension teacher and author \u003ca href=\"https://stgermainmysteryschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maureen St. Germain\u003c/a> spoke about navigating different dimensions, particularly the transition from the third dimension (3D) to the fifth dimension (5D). While 3D is marked by judgment and emotional turbulence, &quot;5D is a place where we feel joy in our hearts,&quot; devoid of polarity and judgment, she said. St. Germain, who learned much of her metaphysical wisdom from spirit guides, further explained that the fourth dimension serves as a transitional phase, often experienced unknowingly before one slides into 5D. On the subject of the afterlife, she maintained that reincarnation is not a necessity once we are in spirit form. Though deceased relatives may try to guide you along the reincarnation path in the afterlife, you still have free will even after you die, she pointed out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She emphasized the importance of meditation and maintaining a positive mindset to sustain a 5D existence (she is offering two \u003ca href=\"https://stgermainmysteryschool.com/5d-life-gifts/\" target=\"_blank\">free meditation downloads\u003c/a> to C2C listeners). According to St. Germain, in living a 5D life, one's perspective shifts from competition to collaboration and personal growth, underscoring a future where kindness prevails. She also addressed the concept of the \u003ca href=\"https://edgarcayce.org/edgar-cayce/readings/akashic-records/\" target=\"_blank\">Akashic Records\u003c/a> and their significance in understanding one's spiritual journeys. She explained, &quot;Your life review is similar to what clients find in the Akashic Records, but the Akashic can give you more information.&quot; For instance, one man learned through a Records reading that his troubled relationship with his daughter stemmed from their past lives as &quot;arch enemies.&quot; By delving into one's Akashic Records they can be changed, which can have positive effects on the present, she added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://www.kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Species-Science-Routledge-Conservation-Environment/dp/1032480521/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Species, Science and Society\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Earth-Planets-Amazing-Species/dp/0452298148/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">What on Earth? 100 of Our Planet's Most Amazing New Species\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Be-Genie-Maureen-St-Germain/dp/0991189833/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Be A Genie: Create Love, Success and Happiness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reweaving-Fabric-Your-Reality-Transformation/dp/0972179968/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159143405X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Flower of Life\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"Pat Boone","title":"Friendly Persuasion","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GC9CFW3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GC9CFW3"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122KGOU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122KGOU"},{"artist":"Cream","title":"White Room","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NCLS6E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NCLS6E"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0YLVE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0YLVE"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Time After Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000ULGMBK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000ULGMBK"},{"artist":"Emerson Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Whitney Houston","title":"I Wanna Dance With Somebody","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00IZ13AT4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00IZ13AT4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Dean Martin","title":"Sway","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EPOHPQO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EPOHPQO"},{"artist":"Bruce Hornsby","title":"The Way It Is","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SQA0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SQA0"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me To The River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Morphing Through Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LZRZ1J/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LZRZ1J"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1AFRA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F64b08d6b66f62a443b5b3e85","%2F5e01391ecc137bf2442023e8"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/dimensions","keywords/time","keywords/species extinction"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e417dad85854f4726fbfb6","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e417ead85854f4726fbfb7","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e4180cd85854f4726fbfb8","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e4181ed85854f4726fbfb9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Man walking into different dimension.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he shared insights into the state of biodiversity and the pressing need for species documentation, as well as why he believes we have entered the first mass extinction event since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. &quot;We're probably losing something on the order of 20,000 species a year,&quot; he lamented, adding that the loss is exacerbated by human activities, including habitat destruction and pollution. If unaddressed, this could lead to a staggering 80% of Earth's species vanishing within the next 200-300 years.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>With only about 20% of Earth's species identified, Wheeler emphasized the urgency of exploration and taxonomic research: &quot;If we don't pick up the pace, we certainly will lose a lot of species and have no evidence that they ever existed.&quot; Perhaps some ten million species have yet to be identified, and while insects represent about half of the known species, the actual biodiversity, including fungi and other invertebrates, is likely underestimated. He proposed that with a modest investment of $1 billion annually, we could document millions of unnamed species within 50 years, arguing, &quot;The amount of knowledge we would gain... sounds like a bargain to me.&quot; He also expressed some cautious optimism, saying, &quot;I don't think it's too late to slow the rate of extinction&quot; if we adapt our relationship with the environment to ensure a diverse and thriving planet.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half ascension teacher and author \u003ca href=\"https://stgermainmysteryschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maureen St. Germain\u003c/a> spoke about navigating different dimensions, particularly the transition from the third dimension (3D) to the fifth dimension (5D). While 3D is marked by judgment and emotional turbulence, &quot;5D is a place where we feel joy in our hearts,&quot; devoid of polarity and judgment, she said. St. Germain, who learned much of her metaphysical wisdom from spirit guides, further explained that the fourth dimension serves as a transitional phase, often experienced unknowingly before one slides into 5D. On the subject of the afterlife, she maintained that reincarnation is not a necessity once we are in spirit form. Though deceased relatives may try to guide you along the reincarnation path in the afterlife, you still have free will even after you die, she pointed out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She emphasized the importance of meditation and maintaining a positive mindset to sustain a 5D existence (she is offering two \u003ca href=\"https://stgermainmysteryschool.com/5d-life-gifts/\" target=\"_blank\">free meditation downloads\u003c/a> to C2C listeners). According to St. Germain, in living a 5D life, one's perspective shifts from competition to collaboration and personal growth, underscoring a future where kindness prevails. She also addressed the concept of the \u003ca href=\"https://edgarcayce.org/edgar-cayce/readings/akashic-records/\" target=\"_blank\">Akashic Records\u003c/a> and their significance in understanding one's spiritual journeys. She explained, &quot;Your life review is similar to what clients find in the Akashic Records, but the Akashic can give you more information.&quot; For instance, one man learned through a Records reading that his troubled relationship with his daughter stemmed from their past lives as &quot;arch enemies.&quot; By delving into one's Akashic Records they can be changed, which can have positive effects on the present, she added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://www.kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Species-Science-Routledge-Conservation-Environment/dp/1032480521/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Species, Science and Society\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Earth-Planets-Amazing-Species/dp/0452298148/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">What on Earth? 100 of Our Planet's Most Amazing New Species\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Be-Genie-Maureen-St-Germain/dp/0991189833/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Be A Genie: Create Love, Success and Happiness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reweaving-Fabric-Your-Reality-Transformation/dp/0972179968/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159143405X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Flower of Life\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"Pat Boone","title":"Friendly Persuasion","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GC9CFW3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GC9CFW3"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122KGOU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122KGOU"},{"artist":"Cream","title":"White Room","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NCLS6E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NCLS6E"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0YLVE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0YLVE"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Time After Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000ULGMBK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000ULGMBK"},{"artist":"Emerson Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Whitney Houston","title":"I Wanna Dance With Somebody","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00IZ13AT4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00IZ13AT4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Dean Martin","title":"Sway","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EPOHPQO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EPOHPQO"},{"artist":"Bruce Hornsby","title":"The Way It Is","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SQA0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SQA0"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me To The River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Morphing Through Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LZRZ1J/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LZRZ1J"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1AFRA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F64b08d6b66f62a443b5b3e85","%2F5e01391ecc137bf2442023e8"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/dimensions","keywords/time","keywords/species extinction"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e417dad85854f4726fbfb6","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e417ead85854f4726fbfb7","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e4180cd85854f4726fbfb8","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e4181ed85854f4726fbfb9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Man walking into different dimension.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

and species explorer \u003ca href=\"https://quentinwheeler.godaddysites.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Quentin Wheeler\u003c/a> has named more than 100 new species, and published more than 175 scientific papers. In the first half, he shared insights into the state of biodiversity and the pressing need for species documentation, as well as why he believes we have entered the first mass extinction event since the disappearance of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. &quot;We're probably losing something on the order of 20,000 species a year,&quot; he lamented, adding that the loss is exacerbated by human activities, including habitat destruction and pollution. If unaddressed, this could lead to a staggering 80% of Earth's species vanishing within the next 200-300 years.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>With only about 20% of Earth's species identified, Wheeler emphasized the urgency of exploration and taxonomic research: &quot;If we don't pick up the pace, we certainly will lose a lot of species and have no evidence that they ever existed.&quot; Perhaps some ten million species have yet to be identified, and while insects represent about half of the known species, the actual biodiversity, including fungi and other invertebrates, is likely underestimated. He proposed that with a modest investment of $1 billion annually, we could document millions of unnamed species within 50 years, arguing, &quot;The amount of knowledge we would gain... sounds like a bargain to me.&quot; He also expressed some cautious optimism, saying, &quot;I don't think it's too late to slow the rate of extinction&quot; if we adapt our relationship with the environment to ensure a diverse and thriving planet.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half ascension teacher and author \u003ca href=\"https://stgermainmysteryschool.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Maureen St. Germain\u003c/a> spoke about navigating different dimensions, particularly the transition from the third dimension (3D) to the fifth dimension (5D). While 3D is marked by judgment and emotional turbulence, &quot;5D is a place where we feel joy in our hearts,&quot; devoid of polarity and judgment, she said. St. Germain, who learned much of her metaphysical wisdom from spirit guides, further explained that the fourth dimension serves as a transitional phase, often experienced unknowingly before one slides into 5D. On the subject of the afterlife, she maintained that reincarnation is not a necessity once we are in spirit form. Though deceased relatives may try to guide you along the reincarnation path in the afterlife, you still have free will even after you die, she pointed out.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She emphasized the importance of meditation and maintaining a positive mindset to sustain a 5D existence (she is offering two \u003ca href=\"https://stgermainmysteryschool.com/5d-life-gifts/\" target=\"_blank\">free meditation downloads\u003c/a> to C2C listeners). According to St. Germain, in living a 5D life, one's perspective shifts from competition to collaboration and personal growth, underscoring a future where kindness prevails. She also addressed the concept of the \u003ca href=\"https://edgarcayce.org/edgar-cayce/readings/akashic-records/\" target=\"_blank\">Akashic Records\u003c/a> and their significance in understanding one's spiritual journeys. She explained, &quot;Your life review is similar to what clients find in the Akashic Records, but the Akashic can give you more information.&quot; For instance, one man learned through a Records reading that his troubled relationship with his daughter stemmed from their past lives as &quot;arch enemies.&quot; By delving into one's Akashic Records they can be changed, which can have positive effects on the present, she added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.myheartbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Christian Wilde\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://www.kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Species-Science-Routledge-Conservation-Environment/dp/1032480521/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Species, Science and Society\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-Earth-Planets-Amazing-Species/dp/0452298148/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">What on Earth? 100 of Our Planet's Most Amazing New Species\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Be-Genie-Maureen-St-Germain/dp/0991189833/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Be A Genie: Create Love, Success and Happiness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Reweaving-Fabric-Your-Reality-Transformation/dp/0972179968/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Reweaving the Fabric of Your Reality\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159143405X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Flower of Life\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"Pat Boone","title":"Friendly Persuasion","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GC9CFW3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GC9CFW3"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122KGOU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122KGOU"},{"artist":"Cream","title":"White Room","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NCLS6E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NCLS6E"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0YLVE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0YLVE"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Time After Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000ULGMBK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000ULGMBK"},{"artist":"Emerson Lake & Palmer","title":"Fanfare For The Common Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HO16KK6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HO16KK6"},{"artist":"Whitney Houston","title":"I Wanna Dance With Somebody","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00IZ13AT4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00IZ13AT4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Shadows In Silence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD990A/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD990A"},{"artist":"Dean Martin","title":"Sway","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EPOHPQO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EPOHPQO"},{"artist":"Bruce Hornsby","title":"The Way It Is","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SQA0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SQA0"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me To The River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Morphing Through Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LZRZ1J/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LZRZ1J"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1AFRA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F64b08d6b66f62a443b5b3e85","%2F5e01391ecc137bf2442023e8"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/dimensions","keywords/time","keywords/species extinction"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e417dad85854f4726fbfb6","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e417ead85854f4726fbfb7","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e4180cd85854f4726fbfb8","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e4181ed85854f4726fbfb9","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Sep 12 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Man walking into different dimension.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

In the first half, he discussed his law enforcement experiences, including being a first responder at Ground Zero in NYC on 9/11, as well as what he believes contributes to societal chaos and division in America. Reflecting on the harrowing events of the September 11th attack, he noted the spirit of unity that emerged in the aftermath. He poignantly acknowledged the bravery of first responders, commenting, &quot;Instead of seeing the officers running the other way, they were running towards a disaster.&quot; He also highlighted the extraordinary efforts of volunteers from across the country, who drove for days to offer support, brought their own equipment, and were willing to stay as long as needed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Outlining the deep divisions in American society, he attributed them to a lack of accountability and respect for law and order. He suggested that there has been an alarming rise in crime and societal unrest, stating, &quot;When you have gangs of young people...just smashing and grabbing...it's indicative of a larger problem.&quot; Letts criticized the educational system for neglecting to teach values and principles, and focusing on academia over practical skills. He also pointed to the role of social media in perpetuating divisiveness, arguing that it allows for anonymity and a lack of accountability. Another issue Letts raised concerns about is the significant drop in law enforcement and military recruits. &quot;This is going to be a national security crisis for our country,&quot; he warned.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, editor and author \u003ca href=\"https://kris-spisak.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kris Spisak\u003c/a> delved deep into Baba Yaga, an enigmatic witch, shapeshifter, and trickster from Slavic folklore, described as both an old hag and an enchantress. Highlighting her duality as both a source of fear and a potential life coach, Baba Yaga is often mischaracterized as merely evil, she explained, adding that &quot;When there's darkness in the world, don't be afraid of it...sometimes through that darkness...our greatest transformations exist.&quot; According to the lore, if one approaches Baba Yaga with bravery and hard work, she can act as a beneficial force, akin to a fairy godmother. Drawing from her Ukrainian heritage, Spisak emphasized Baba Yaga's regional significance: &quot;You can really pinpoint her in about 10 different countries.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She traced Baba Yaga's origins back about 7000 years, noting that she symbolizes the light and the dark. Rather than a scary monster, &quot;she is a catalyst for change and judgment,&quot; Spisak said, illustrating Baba Yaga as a complex character who was known to ask, &quot;Are you here to do deeds, or are you here to run from them?&quot; This question invites people to examine their intentions, and serves as a daily mantra for self-reflection. Spisak described Baba Yaga's \u003ca href=\"https://cryptids12-everything.fandom.com/wiki/Baba_Yaga_House?file=Baba_Yaga_House.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">chicken-legged house\u003c/a> as something that could represent resourcefulness and the desire for escapism or the ability to migrate quickly.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He highlighted the role of nutrition in preventing chronic diseases like diabetes and autoimmune disorders, arguing that many health challenges stem from &quot;nutritional deficiencies and our digestive system.&quot; He also addressed common health issues, such as skin conditions, noting, &quot;Skin is the body's largest organ,&quot; and it's dependent on nutrition, particularly fatty nutrients like EFA and vitamins D, E, A, and K. He warned against the dangers of ultra-processed foods and the impact of consuming charred meats, as well how certain grains and vegetables contain &quot;plant defense molecules&quot; known as lectins, which can cause digestive issues.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He encouraged listeners to keep a food diary, emphasizing that this simple practice can empower them to identify how specific foods affect their health. &quot;Even so-called good food can be problematic,&quot; he cautioned. For a caller concerned about his daughter's hyperthyroidism, Fuchs suggested that this could be an autoimmune disorder, linked to a leaky gut and intestinal health. He recommended supplements like probiotics and digestive enzymes for digestive support, including conditions like SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth). For more information, he directed listeners to his YouTube channel, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@YOURSKINMATTERS\" target=\"_blank\">Skin Matters\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Author and paranormal investigator \u003ca href=\"https://nicoledstrickland.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nicole Strickland\u003c/a> started a podcast called the Afterlife Chronicles and is the founder of the San Diego Paranormal Research Society. In the latter half, she discussed her exploration of ghosts, hauntings, and the afterlife, as well as the importance of both scientific methodology and metaphysical techniques in paranormal investigations. &quot;There's a difference between thrill-seeking and more legitimate paranormal research,&quot; she pointed out, adding that she believes there should be standardized methodologies to enhance the credibility of paranormal investigations. Strickland described hauntings aboard the Queen Mary, particularly mentioning the spirit of a young girl named Jackie. &quot;I've seen her myself,&quot; she declared. &quot;She almost looks very similar to...Shirley Temple,&quot; around six or seven years old, and likes to play and sing nursery rhymes and songs.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Strickland had concluded that there is solid evidence for the continuation of the soul after death, especially from the research of near-death experiences. She shared some of her own poignant experiences, including dream visitations from her late cat, Kayli. &quot;I've had about 25 dream visitations... I'll feel her footsteps,&quot; she explained, detailing a vivid moment where she witnessed her cat interacting with a mysterious orb, and going through it like a portal. As for advice on conducting paranormal investigations, she noted the importance of always having permission to be on the property and providing an unbiased investigation. She starts out trying to understand the claims and experiences that people are reporting, and using her human senses rather than bringing a lot of equipment onto a site, though an infrared camera and multiple audio recorders can be helpful.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Funded by the Bigelow Institute, his research explores the reality of mediumship (the study results were recently published in the book \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Urgent-Message-Humanity-Groundbreaking-Scientific/dp/B0DFMW7RYR/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">An Urgent Message for Humanity\u003c/a>). He described the study's innovative approach, which incorporated the use of controlled remote viewing-- using numerical codes to pose questions to mediums, who were able to give accurate responses. To Morse, because of the proven extraordinary abilities of the mediums (including one who has been an FBI agent for 27 years and is known for solving cold cases), he is absolutely convinced of the reality of the afterlife.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The 19 mediums in their study were all shown to manipulate streams of electrons through their minds by making random number generators behave more coherently. They did this for up to ten minutes at a time, he reported. Asked about humanity's development, the mediums all shared a similar call for humankind to heed spiritual guidance or risk dire consequences, specifically &quot;Learn to love or face extinction.&quot; As part of the testing of the mediums, some were assigned to make contact with living people. Given just a target number (which represented an older hospitalized woman) the patient suddenly heard someone saying, &quot;Hello, are you there?&quot; And she felt a touch on her arm, as the medium reached out to her. As for a scientific explanation behind the mediums' abilities, Morse likens the brain to an &quot;antenna&quot; capable of receiving signals from an &quot;informational universe.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and Christian ufologist \u003ca href=\"http://aliensinthebible.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Milor\u003c/a> discussed the intersection of faith and extraterrestrial phenomena, emphasizing that believers need not abandon their faith in light of UFO realities. Elaborating on his evolving beliefs about UFOs, he noted a shift from viewing them solely as demonic to recognizing a duality, which includes benevolent forces, like in the Bible when it talks about Elijah being lifted up into a chariot. Milor foresees that there will be an alien mass abduction, but he cautions that it will be misinterpreted as a hostile invasion when it is actually akin to the Rapture when millions or even billions of Christians will vanish.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The Antichrist will appear like an &quot;otherworldly savior&quot; in a forthcoming &quot;strong delusion,&quot; and he is potentially a Nephilim or fallen angel with supernatural abilities, capable of performing miraculous acts, Milor stated. On the topic of cryptids, he expressed a belief that Bigfoot might be a &quot;transgenic species,&quot; capable of appearing and disappearing in this dimension and that cryptids, in general, could be a type of Nephilim-- animal-angel hybrids. Milor also shared intriguing claims about military activities in Antarctica. He recounted whistleblower reports of underground facilities, two to three miles underneath the ice, with advanced, possibly ET technology, including illuminating walls.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://theskylive.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Steve Kates\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Urgent-Message-Humanity-Groundbreaking-Scientific/dp/B0DFMW7RYR/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">An Urgent Message for Humanity\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061095044/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Where God Lives: The Science of the Paranormal and How Our Brains are Linked to the Universe\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679427546/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Parting Visions: Pre-Death Visions and Spiritual Experiences\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Aliens-Antichrist-Unveiling-Times-Deception/dp/0595372384/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Aliens and the Anitchrist\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Aliens-Bible-John-W-Milor/dp/0738808172/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Aliens in the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NRD89WN/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Ufology\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM74C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM74C"},{"artist":"Sammy Davis Jr.","title":"I’ve Gotta Be Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001229HNQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The The","title":"Lung Shadows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LVB6PN/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LVB6PN"},{"artist":"Blue Oyster Cult","title":"Don’t Fear The Reaper","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138EX1K/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Changes","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D36EYY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B015D36EYY"},{"artist":"Massive Attack","title":"Protection","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVJYS/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday On My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XKC7S9M/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XKC7S9M"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Mea Culpa","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001LKQDDG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001LKQDDG"},{"artist":"Johnny Mathis","title":"Chances Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136LD3S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136LD3S"},{"artist":"Edgar Winter","title":"Frankenstein","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136JDS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136JDS0"},{"artist":"U2","title":"Beautiful Day","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O59AKG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O59AKG"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Silence Must Be Heard","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDEZUO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDEZUO"},{"artist":"Roger Whitaker","title":"The Last Farewell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136Q5ZY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136Q5ZY"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e0003ad537fd678a3ece6c7","%2F5e00a7cb537fd678a3ecece2"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/spiritual sight","keywords/aliens","keywords/Antarctica"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e0255152e2f008740706ff","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 9 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e0256252e2f00874070700","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 9 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e0257452e2f00874070701","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 9 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66e0258552e2f00874070702","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Sep 9 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A group of aliens emerging from the light at the end of a dark sinister tunnel.

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Lloyd emphasized that his role is to facilitate self-healing rather than diagnosing or curing ailments. &quot;The body wants to be in a perfectly healed state... but when energy interference comes in, that's what creates disease,&quot; he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/THIS-gonna-sound-weird-Experiences/dp/B0C1J9CWVM/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">THIS is Gonna Sound Weird\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Los Lobos","title":"La Bamba","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002YRU0EI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002YRU0EI"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"I Just Can't Stop Loving You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0096Y9A3E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0096Y9A3E"},{"artist":"Tiffany","title":"I Think We're Alone Now","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZXCTA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZXCTA"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"U Got The Look","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8S3P2P/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08Q8S3P2P"},{"artist":"The Whispers","title":"Rock Steady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07GR8JR8P/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07GR8JR8P"},{"artist":"Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam","title":"Lost In Emotion","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137V1ZC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137V1ZC"},{"artist":"LL Cool J","title":"I Need Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZFS2O/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZFS2O"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Who's That Girl","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012FB3W6/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Huey Lewis And The News","title":"Doing It All For My Baby","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDWS7G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDWS7G"},{"artist":"Debbie Gibson","title":"Only in My Dreams","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002FVTLVQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002FVTLVQ"},{"artist":"Richard Marx","title":"Don't Mean Nothing","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TE5MIC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TE5MIC"},{"artist":"Suzanne Vega","title":"Luka","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W00K2Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W00K2Q"},{"artist":"John Mellencamp","title":"Paper In Fire","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZMWUM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZMWUM"},{"artist":"Smokey Robinson","title":"One Heartbeat","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003I2KP6Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003I2KP6Q"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66d93fd80acb45fc2c6ab004","%2F66d944d70acb45fc2c6ab013"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/paranormal","keywords/encounters","keywords/NDE"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ded13f55f549762efefa16","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Sep 8 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ded14d55f549762efefa17","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Sep 8 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ded15d55f549762efefa18","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Sep 8 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/66ded16b55f549762efefa19","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Sep 8 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Conceptual artwork representing a near-death experience.

Corsi believes Lee Harvey Oswald was deeply involved with the CIA and FBI during the time of the assassination, but that he was set up as a patsy.&quot; Corsi argued that government documents and medical evidence, such as altered X-rays, indicate JFK was shot from the front, not from the Texas School Book Depository. He presented his analysis in his book, which includes Dr. Mantik's optical density measurements of JFK's X-rays, claiming they were forged to hide the true nature of the shots.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Corsi recounted his personal experiences from the time of the assassination and reflected on how, even at 17, he felt the official narrative was too convenient. According to Corsi, the CIA and the government have lied for decades about key events, from the JFK assassination to more recent government actions, such as money laundering and voter fraud. Corsi asserted that JFK's assassination was a coup d'etat orchestrated by the deep state and that Oswald's portrayal as the lone gunman was a deliberate deception. He also drew parallels between the JFK assassination and modern political events, suggesting that the deep state continues to manipulate and control outcomes, citing both the JFK assassination and more recent events, like the recent attempt on Donald Trump's life.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Corsi believes that the government has consistently concealed the truth from the public, particularly regarding sensitive political matters, and that this has continued for over six decades. Corsi expressed optimism about Donald Trump's potential release of all JFK assassination records if Trump becomes president again. Corsi believes that, eventually, the records will be released and will likely reveal that Lee Harvey Oswald was working closely with the CIA at the time of the assassination. He suggested that this connection between Oswald and the CIA is a deep secret that the agency has been trying to cover up.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the latter part of the program, remote viewing teacher \u003ca href=\"https://www.remoteviewingmatrix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Major Ed Dames\u003c/a> talked about the concept of remote viewing and his current cases, including Bigfoot activity and the Shroud of Turin (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/ed-dames-shroud-of-turin-bigfoot-activity/\" target=\"_self\">view related images\u003c/a>). Dames described remote viewing as a form of systematic ESP. He explained that everyone is born with some degree of psychic ability, much like an innate instinct, and that remote viewing hones this ability into a skill through rigorous training. Dames recalled his training under Ingo Swann, a renowned psychic, and his introduction to remote viewing through challenging blind targets, such as sketching the Washington Monument without prior knowledge of the target. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dames reported on his remote viewing experiences related to Bigfoot, suggesting that the creature is connected to UFO phenomena. According to Dames, Bigfoot is part of a technology far beyond human comprehension, which allows them to &quot;beam down&quot; and &quot;pop back up.&quot; He suggested that Bigfoot sightings seem to act as a form of baiting humanity, hinting at a larger system at play that is beyond our understanding. Dames also touched on his past UFO contact attempts, including a project in Chaco Canyon which aimed for formal extraterrestrial contact but yielded limited results. He has now identified a Bigfoot hotspot in California's Stanislaus National Forest as a potential location for further formal contact.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dames shared his insights on the Shroud of Turin, explaining that he conducted a remote viewing session to explore the moment of death of the person whose image is embedded on the cloth. His viewing led him to a location in Jerusalem. Through further investigation, Dames identified the exact spot of the crucifixion, which he claims is about 1.5 kilometers east-northeast of the traditionally believed location at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Dames pinpointed the site as a high point on the Mount of Olives, near a Greek Orthodox Viri Galilaei Church. He asserted that this precise spot is where Jesus was crucified. He also mentioned his intention to find Christ’s tomb, which is traditionally believed to be located at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher but remains uncertain.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Assassination-President-John-Kennedy-Headshots/dp/B0CYH2XBRH/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Assassination of President John F.

With a background that includes multiple psychology-related degrees and accolades, Woodard's interest in the supernatural was influenced by significant figures in his life, such as his family priest and a college mentor. Over time, his clinical practice exposed him to patients sharing detailed, personal supernatural experiences, which led him to explore these phenomena further and eventually write books on the subject. Woodard defined a supernatural event as an internal experience that manifests externally and causes a transformation in the individual, and his research focuses on using these experiences to help people open up to new possibilities in their lives.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One of Woodard's most notable insights is that supernatural experiences are often deeply personal and unique to the individual. Through hypnosis, he has helped patients uncover latent paranormal awareness, frequently validating experiences that defy rational explanation. His approach emphasizes feeling through experiences rather than just imagining or thinking about them, as this can enhance one's ability to connect with the supernatural. Woodard shared multiple patient stories, such as a woman who encountered her deceased father in a dream, who guided her to find crucial documents and another who was saved from suicidal thoughts by a near-death experience. According to Woodard, his clinical peers have supported his work, appreciating his scientific approach rooted in phenomenology, where he captures the simplest essence of patients' experiences without embellishing them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In his practice, Woodard has encountered a variety of supernatural occurrences, ranging from near-death experiences to premonitions of tragic events. While not everyone is open to or capable of experiencing such phenomena, he believes many have the potential for supernatural awareness. His book, Developing Your Supernatural Awareness, provides techniques to help people tap into this potential, including feeling through experiences rather than relying solely on intellect. Woodard also touched on the ethics of using supernatural gifts responsibly and acknowledged that while some individuals have heightened abilities, others may unintentionally drain energy from those around them. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The latter half of the program was devoted to Open Lines. Rick shared his experiences of strange events in an old house he lived in as a teenager, which led him to believe in the paranormal despite his initial skepticism. He and his siblings heard unexplained noises from the attic, saw curtains blow inward in an impossible way, and one of his roommates refused to enter the house after seeing eerie figures. A neighbor later revealed that a mentally challenged son of a Protestant priest had died in a fire in the attic many years earlier. Although Rick tried to cleanse the house with sage, he is convinced it remains haunted and believes the new owners may experience the same phenomena.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ron shared a ghost story from the early 1970s when he was in high school and worked a second-shift job. After hearing rumors of ghost sightings at a nearby church graveyard, Ron and some friends decided to visit and see for themselves. That night, they saw what appeared to be a ghost slowly moving through the cemetery. Ron quickly realized it was their friend Bill, dressed in a sheet, trying to prank them. However, a second ghostly figure emerged from the back of the graveyard and disappeared into the shadows, which startled one of the boys so much that he ran away in fear. Though Ron suspected a prank, he admitted the experience was unsettling.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Henry, from Marin County, California, shared his experiences of being targeted by mysterious groups, which he believes to be a combination of humans and possibly aliens. He described feeling persecuted over several months, with people following him, trying to learn more about him, and repeating voices about someone named Amy or Annie. He suspects these groups are using advanced technologies, such as lasers and infrared sensors, to monitor him. Despite feeling threatened, Henry emphasized that he does not wish to harm anyone and is simply trying to avoid trouble. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final 30 minutes of the show featured a replay of author \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/mctaggart-lynne-5920/\" target=\"_self\">Lynne McTaggart\u003c/a> discussing the power of intention.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://heidihollis.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Heidi Hollis\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> / \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Developing-Your-Supernatural-Awareness-Interactive/dp/1803414782/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Developing Your Supernatural Awareness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Perceptual-Hypnosis-Spiritual-Expanding-Awareness/dp/0764353101/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Perceptual Hypnosis\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01HDMST8C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01HDMST8C"},{"artist":"R.E.M.","title":"Losing My Religion","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LF43OCU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LF43OCU"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"Big Log","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122KGOU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122KGOU"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Fly Me To The Moon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00FHU1908/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00FHU1908"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K60G4CQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K60G4CQ"},{"artist":"Argent","title":"Hold Your Head Up","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00MH3ISOI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00MH3ISOI"},{"artist":"Edgar Winter","title":"Frankenstein","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136JDS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136JDS0"},{"artist":"Nancy Sinatra","title":"Some Velvet Morning","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09WPWSTFG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B09WPWSTFG"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Age Of Loneliness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB3JU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB3JU"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1AFRA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Wilco","title":"Shouldn't Be Ashamed","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001QTMFAW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001QTMFAW"},{"artist":"ABBA","title":"Dancing Queen","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073LNHR1F/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073LNHR1F"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Beyond The Invisible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073M1F88S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073M1F88S"},{"artist":"World Party","title":"When You Come Back To Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001BKGMXC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001BKGMXC"},{"artist":"UFO Phil","title":"Listening to Coast to Coast","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0777PT81Y/ctoc"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F66d10d12057b4edb64806402","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hypnosis","keywords/paranormal"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/66dc33a07d54f16036d7809b","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Sep 6 2024 -

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

All the food in supermarkets would quickly spoil and our whole digital way of life would come to a standstill, he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Forstchen criticized presidential candidate Kamala Harris for not addressing the threat of EMPs targeting the US, and shared his belief that Donald Trump would take the issue more seriously if he were reelected. He also assessed the ability and willingness of other countries when it comes to launching these EMP attacks, noting that several of our adversaries wouldn't dare wipe out the US power grid because of existing trade agreements. Isolated countries such as North Korea, however, wouldn't hesitate to launch such an attack if they were capable, Forstchen said. The conversation also touched on the Carrington Event of 1859, which was the strongest and most disruptive solar flare on record.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final three hours of the program featured podcasters from Coast to Coast AM's \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\">Paranormal Podcast Network\u003c/a>. \u003ca href=\"http://wedontdie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandra Champlain\u003c/a>, who hosts the show Shades of the Afterlife, spoke about her unshakeable belief in a realm beyond death. &quot;I have zero doubts that the afterlife exists,&quot; she asserted. She also highlighted how adversity makes us spiritually stronger, noting that our souls grow during difficult times. Life's balance of good and bad is an essential part of human development, she claimed: &quot;In order to experience joy, we need to experience sadness.&quot; Champlain told listeners how she doesn't bother trying to convince close-minded skeptics of life after death, but instead focuses on others who are open to the idea of a higher spiritual realm. When asked to describe this transcendent place, she painted a picture of a world that looks very much like the one we live in. &quot;Even our pets are there,&quot; she insisted, while also emphasizing how souls can communicate telepathically in the afterlife. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"http://joshuapwarren.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joshua P. Warren\u003c/a>, who hosts the Strange Things podcast, spoke next about topics ranging from healing holy water to Nikola Tesla's purple plate technology. He shared how spring water from the city of Lourdes in France shows crosses and other Christian symbols when absorbing certain frequencies. This water, which allegedly appeared after a young girl saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary, reportedly has the power to cure a wide range of illnesses. Regarding Tesla's purple plates, Warren described how these anodized metal slabs are passive antennas for &quot;bio-energy&quot;, also known as &quot;chi&quot; in China or as &quot;prana&quot; in India. He detailed his own process for channeling this energy in \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/master-manifestor-ritual/\" target=\"_blank\">this diagram here\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final guest, Captain \u003ca href=\"https://contactinthedesert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ron Janix\u003c/a> from the podcast Beyond Contact, spoke about his research into ufology and paranormal phenomena. When asked about UFO sightings, he claimed that &quot;99.9% have a terrestrial explanation.&quot; Janix explained how both believers and non-believers make assertions about these sightings before conducting an appropriate level of research. It's a problem that extends beyond just UFOs, he said. &quot;Someone will believe in Bigfoot and say, 'Loch Ness Monster? That's silly!'&quot; According to Janix, demanding government disclosure of extraterrestrial phenomena is futile. &quot;I don't think we're going to get anything from the government,&quot; he revealed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://drchrisgilbert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Chris Gilbert\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://nelkenfoodsafetycoach.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Jeff Nelken\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Year-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765376709//ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">One Year After\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Final-Day-Novel-John-Matherson/dp/0765376733/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Final Day: A Novel\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Five-Years-After-Matherson-Novel/dp/1250854563/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Five Years After: A John Matherson Novel \u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/We-Dont-Die-Skeptics-Discovery/dp/1614483825//ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">We Don't Die: A Skeptic's Discovery of Life After Death\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://freecharm.com/FindingYourMagic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Finding Your Magick\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://freecharm.com/DeathValley/DeathValley.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ghosts, UFOs, &amp;

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

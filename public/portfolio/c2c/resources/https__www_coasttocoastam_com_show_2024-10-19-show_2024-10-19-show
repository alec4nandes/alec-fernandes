type-html"><div class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, <a href="https://facebook.com/mrhaunted" target="_blank">Jimmy Petonito</a> — better known as &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — joined host <a href="https://www.conniewillis.com/" target="_blank">Connie Willis</a> (<a href="https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/meet-connie-willis/" target="_blank">info</a> &amp; <a href="https://x.com/conniewillisx" target="_blank">X</a>) on her 10th anniversary with C2C to discuss his many spooky encounters. Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.</p>

<p>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;</p>

<p>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.</p>

<p>----------------------</p>

<p>In the second half, cryptid researcher <a href="https://truthproof.uk/" target="_blank">Paul Sinclair</a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen. He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.</p>

<p>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;</p>

<p>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train. She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.</p>

<p>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;</p>

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, cryptid researcher \u003ca href=\"https://truthproof.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sinclair\u003c/a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen.

She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6-10pm PT: Art Bell - \u003cem>Somewhere in Time\u003c/em> returned to 10/24/96 for a night of Open Lines, including such topics as Martian anomalies and the Egyptian pyramids.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Haunted-head-spinning-cemeteries-assisting/dp/B0D5752RN7/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Haunted - Origins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-Messages-Chilling-Letters-Emails/dp/1938875176/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom Messages\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Proof-2-Beyond-Thinking-Mind-ebook/dp/B0791862LC/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 2: Beyond The Thinking Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V3FKBK2/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 3: Bringing Down the Light\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Night-People-Truth-Proof-Book-ebook/dp/B08CZJPSMZ/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Night People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Village People","title":"Y.M.C.A.","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LZODXRW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LZODXRW"},{"artist":"Bee Gees","title":"Stayin Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01NBN2IS1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01NBN2IS1"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"Thriller","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013D6LEM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"Angry Young Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137RN7W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137RN7W"},{"artist":"Chic","title":"Le Freak","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O7WD12/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O7WD12"},{"artist":"Eddy Grant","title":"Electric Avenue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9QDVQV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CN9QDVQV"},{"artist":"Loverboy","title":"Working For The Weekend","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137TUC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137TUC8"},{"artist":"Beyoncé","title":"Single Ladies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KR1IBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KR1IBW"},{"artist":"Aerosmith","title":"Walk This Way","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPK2R3Z1/ctoc"},{"artist":"M/A/R/R/S","title":"Pump Up The Volume","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SFV4SO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SFV4SO"},{"artist":"Usher","title":"Yeah!","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073WN6RF5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073WN6RF5"},{"artist":"Kool and The Gang","title":"Celebration","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZRA4S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZRA4S"},{"artist":"Cyndi Lauper","title":"Girls Just Want to Have Fun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GLAM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GLAM"},{"artist":"The Weather Girls","title":"It's Raining Men","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SX94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SX94"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F671194134da9535feb86b2c9","%2F5e9922c31f6a81c860bbc69a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hauntings","keywords/Dogman","keywords/cryptids"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef7ba4fb34deedc18a25","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef8da4fb34deedc18a26","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef9ca4fb34deedc18a27","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714efb2a4fb34deedc18a28","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A spooky concept of a ghostly figure silhouetted between trees in a forest on a moody, foggy winters day.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore.

He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train. She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6-10pm PT: Art Bell - \u003cem>Somewhere in Time\u003c/em> returned to 10/24/96 for a night of Open Lines, including such topics as Martian anomalies and the Egyptian pyramids.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Haunted-head-spinning-cemeteries-assisting/dp/B0D5752RN7/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Haunted - Origins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-Messages-Chilling-Letters-Emails/dp/1938875176/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom Messages\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Proof-2-Beyond-Thinking-Mind-ebook/dp/B0791862LC/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 2: Beyond The Thinking Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V3FKBK2/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 3: Bringing Down the Light\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Night-People-Truth-Proof-Book-ebook/dp/B08CZJPSMZ/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Night People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Village People","title":"Y.M.C.A.","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LZODXRW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LZODXRW"},{"artist":"Bee Gees","title":"Stayin Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01NBN2IS1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01NBN2IS1"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"Thriller","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013D6LEM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"Angry Young Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137RN7W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137RN7W"},{"artist":"Chic","title":"Le Freak","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O7WD12/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O7WD12"},{"artist":"Eddy Grant","title":"Electric Avenue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9QDVQV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CN9QDVQV"},{"artist":"Loverboy","title":"Working For The Weekend","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137TUC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137TUC8"},{"artist":"Beyoncé","title":"Single Ladies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KR1IBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KR1IBW"},{"artist":"Aerosmith","title":"Walk This Way","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPK2R3Z1/ctoc"},{"artist":"M/A/R/R/S","title":"Pump Up The Volume","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SFV4SO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SFV4SO"},{"artist":"Usher","title":"Yeah!","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073WN6RF5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073WN6RF5"},{"artist":"Kool and The Gang","title":"Celebration","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZRA4S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZRA4S"},{"artist":"Cyndi Lauper","title":"Girls Just Want to Have Fun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GLAM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GLAM"},{"artist":"The Weather Girls","title":"It's Raining Men","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SX94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SX94"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F671194134da9535feb86b2c9","%2F5e9922c31f6a81c860bbc69a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hauntings","keywords/Dogman","keywords/cryptids"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef7ba4fb34deedc18a25","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef8da4fb34deedc18a26","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef9ca4fb34deedc18a27","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714efb2a4fb34deedc18a28","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A spooky concept of a ghostly figure silhouetted between trees in a forest on a moody, foggy winters day.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, cryptid researcher \u003ca href=\"https://truthproof.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sinclair\u003c/a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen. He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train. She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6-10pm PT: Art Bell - \u003cem>Somewhere in Time\u003c/em> returned to 10/24/96 for a night of Open Lines, including such topics as Martian anomalies and the Egyptian pyramids.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Haunted-head-spinning-cemeteries-assisting/dp/B0D5752RN7/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Haunted - Origins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-Messages-Chilling-Letters-Emails/dp/1938875176/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom Messages\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Proof-2-Beyond-Thinking-Mind-ebook/dp/B0791862LC/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 2: Beyond The Thinking Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V3FKBK2/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 3: Bringing Down the Light\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Night-People-Truth-Proof-Book-ebook/dp/B08CZJPSMZ/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Night People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Village People","title":"Y.M.C.A.","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LZODXRW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LZODXRW"},{"artist":"Bee Gees","title":"Stayin Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01NBN2IS1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01NBN2IS1"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"Thriller","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013D6LEM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"Angry Young Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137RN7W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137RN7W"},{"artist":"Chic","title":"Le Freak","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O7WD12/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O7WD12"},{"artist":"Eddy Grant","title":"Electric Avenue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9QDVQV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CN9QDVQV"},{"artist":"Loverboy","title":"Working For The Weekend","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137TUC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137TUC8"},{"artist":"Beyoncé","title":"Single Ladies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KR1IBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KR1IBW"},{"artist":"Aerosmith","title":"Walk This Way","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPK2R3Z1/ctoc"},{"artist":"M/A/R/R/S","title":"Pump Up The Volume","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SFV4SO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SFV4SO"},{"artist":"Usher","title":"Yeah!","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073WN6RF5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073WN6RF5"},{"artist":"Kool and The Gang","title":"Celebration","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZRA4S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZRA4S"},{"artist":"Cyndi Lauper","title":"Girls Just Want to Have Fun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GLAM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GLAM"},{"artist":"The Weather Girls","title":"It's Raining Men","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SX94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SX94"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F671194134da9535feb86b2c9","%2F5e9922c31f6a81c860bbc69a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hauntings","keywords/Dogman","keywords/cryptids"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef7ba4fb34deedc18a25","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef8da4fb34deedc18a26","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef9ca4fb34deedc18a27","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714efb2a4fb34deedc18a28","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A spooky concept of a ghostly figure silhouetted between trees in a forest on a moody, foggy winters day.

Thames asserted that her encounters were not dreams but real interactions where she was a willing participant. She rejected the notion that she was &quot;abducted&quot;, instead describing her experiences as beneficial interactions governed by &quot;soul contracts&quot;, or agreements made before her incarnation on Earth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thames recounted early memories of being taken aboard crafts by hybrid Greys, noting a deep bond with one particular female Grey. She then distinguished between different types of extraterrestrials while asserting that all share certain abilities. &quot;They are really all interdimensional beings,&quot; Thames clarified. Other entities she interacted with, often referred to as the Elders, were benevolent and luminescent creatures that transcended physical forms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing their spacecrafts, Thames described how she found herself in a vast, sterile environment filled with different alien species. &quot;It's like you step into a whole new dimension,&quot; she said. On board the ship, Thames experienced what she called &quot;kundalini surges&quot;, or increases in energy that opened her subconscious. &quot;They did that to help us remember our soul history,&quot; she revealed, while also mentioning that both she and her son had undergone this awakening. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thames went on to explain the purpose of these ET interactions. &quot;They are reaching out to humanity... [and] want us to raise our frequency,&quot; she insisted. According to her, the most effective way to initiate this process is through intense focus. &quot;The best thing to do is to meditate with intention,&quot; Thames explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half featured Open Lines, where listeners call in to discuss topics of interest.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Chris from Ohio phoned in after a six-month hiatus and talked about microbiologists allegedly collaborating with Chinese scientists on coronavirus diseases 15 years ago.

He warned of potential deception mentioned in the Bible, and encouraged everyone to clearly discern all spiritual experiences.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>James in Virginia spoke about the significance of the September 23, 2017 astrological event related to Revelation 12 in the Bible, claiming it marked a unique biblical sign.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, cryptid researcher \u003ca href=\"https://truthproof.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sinclair\u003c/a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen. He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, cryptid researcher \u003ca href=\"https://truthproof.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sinclair\u003c/a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen. He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train. She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6-10pm PT: Art Bell - \u003cem>Somewhere in Time\u003c/em> returned to 10/24/96 for a night of Open Lines, including such topics as Martian anomalies and the Egyptian pyramids.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Haunted-head-spinning-cemeteries-assisting/dp/B0D5752RN7/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Haunted - Origins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-Messages-Chilling-Letters-Emails/dp/1938875176/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom Messages\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Proof-2-Beyond-Thinking-Mind-ebook/dp/B0791862LC/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 2: Beyond The Thinking Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V3FKBK2/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 3: Bringing Down the Light\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Night-People-Truth-Proof-Book-ebook/dp/B08CZJPSMZ/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Night People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Village People","title":"Y.M.C.A.","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LZODXRW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LZODXRW"},{"artist":"Bee Gees","title":"Stayin Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01NBN2IS1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01NBN2IS1"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"Thriller","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013D6LEM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"Angry Young Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137RN7W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137RN7W"},{"artist":"Chic","title":"Le Freak","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O7WD12/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O7WD12"},{"artist":"Eddy Grant","title":"Electric Avenue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9QDVQV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CN9QDVQV"},{"artist":"Loverboy","title":"Working For The Weekend","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137TUC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137TUC8"},{"artist":"Beyoncé","title":"Single Ladies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KR1IBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KR1IBW"},{"artist":"Aerosmith","title":"Walk This Way","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPK2R3Z1/ctoc"},{"artist":"M/A/R/R/S","title":"Pump Up The Volume","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SFV4SO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SFV4SO"},{"artist":"Usher","title":"Yeah!","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073WN6RF5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073WN6RF5"},{"artist":"Kool and The Gang","title":"Celebration","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZRA4S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZRA4S"},{"artist":"Cyndi Lauper","title":"Girls Just Want to Have Fun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GLAM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GLAM"},{"artist":"The Weather Girls","title":"It's Raining Men","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SX94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SX94"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F671194134da9535feb86b2c9","%2F5e9922c31f6a81c860bbc69a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hauntings","keywords/Dogman","keywords/cryptids"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef7ba4fb34deedc18a25","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef8da4fb34deedc18a26","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef9ca4fb34deedc18a27","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714efb2a4fb34deedc18a28","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A spooky concept of a ghostly figure silhouetted between trees in a forest on a moody, foggy winters day.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, cryptid researcher \u003ca href=\"https://truthproof.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sinclair\u003c/a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen. He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore. As for the name &quot;Mr. Haunted&quot; — Petonito revealed that the title came from teaching ghost-hunting classes at a local high school.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, cryptid researcher \u003ca href=\"https://truthproof.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Sinclair\u003c/a> delved into the world of strange creatures, particularly focusing on werewolves and Dogmen. He emphasized the interconnectedness of these entities, stating, &quot;I think we're talking probably about one and the same.&quot; Sinclair highlighted accounts from the UK that date back centuries, particularly a fascinating tale from a village called Flixton, where werewolf sightings have persisted for over a millennium.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The gripping story was from a witness named Drew, who had a chilling encounter in 2003. &quot;She saw what she could only describe as a werewolf,&quot; Sinclair relayed. &quot;It locked eyes on her and came bounding down the road towards the house.&quot; He noted the creature's eerie grace, revealing that &quot;it went down the side of the house like a spider.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He shared another frightening encounter from a woman named Wendy, who saw an unknown creature while traveling on a train. She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6-10pm PT: Art Bell - \u003cem>Somewhere in Time\u003c/em> returned to 10/24/96 for a night of Open Lines, including such topics as Martian anomalies and the Egyptian pyramids.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Haunted-head-spinning-cemeteries-assisting/dp/B0D5752RN7/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Haunted - Origins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-Messages-Chilling-Letters-Emails/dp/1938875176/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom Messages\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Proof-2-Beyond-Thinking-Mind-ebook/dp/B0791862LC/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 2: Beyond The Thinking Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V3FKBK2/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 3: Bringing Down the Light\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Night-People-Truth-Proof-Book-ebook/dp/B08CZJPSMZ/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Night People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Village People","title":"Y.M.C.A.","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LZODXRW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LZODXRW"},{"artist":"Bee Gees","title":"Stayin Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01NBN2IS1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01NBN2IS1"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"Thriller","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013D6LEM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"Angry Young Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137RN7W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137RN7W"},{"artist":"Chic","title":"Le Freak","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O7WD12/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O7WD12"},{"artist":"Eddy Grant","title":"Electric Avenue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9QDVQV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CN9QDVQV"},{"artist":"Loverboy","title":"Working For The Weekend","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137TUC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137TUC8"},{"artist":"Beyoncé","title":"Single Ladies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KR1IBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KR1IBW"},{"artist":"Aerosmith","title":"Walk This Way","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPK2R3Z1/ctoc"},{"artist":"M/A/R/R/S","title":"Pump Up The Volume","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SFV4SO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SFV4SO"},{"artist":"Usher","title":"Yeah!","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073WN6RF5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073WN6RF5"},{"artist":"Kool and The Gang","title":"Celebration","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZRA4S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZRA4S"},{"artist":"Cyndi Lauper","title":"Girls Just Want to Have Fun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GLAM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GLAM"},{"artist":"The Weather Girls","title":"It's Raining Men","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SX94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SX94"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F671194134da9535feb86b2c9","%2F5e9922c31f6a81c860bbc69a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hauntings","keywords/Dogman","keywords/cryptids"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef7ba4fb34deedc18a25","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef8da4fb34deedc18a26","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef9ca4fb34deedc18a27","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714efb2a4fb34deedc18a28","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A spooky concept of a ghostly figure silhouetted between trees in a forest on a moody, foggy winters day.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore.

She described its glowing amber eyes and human-like legs, exclaiming, &quot;It was the strangest animal I'd ever seen.&quot; The creature seemed to focus on her, intensifying her fear as it charged through the crops beside the train.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sinclair concluded by pondering whether these various phenomena — cryptids, UFOs, and ghosts — are manifestations of a singular intelligence, asking, &quot;Are we dealing with many facets of the unexplained... one that's portraying itself as many things?&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>6-10pm PT: Art Bell - \u003cem>Somewhere in Time\u003c/em> returned to 10/24/96 for a night of Open Lines, including such topics as Martian anomalies and the Egyptian pyramids.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Haunted-head-spinning-cemeteries-assisting/dp/B0D5752RN7/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Haunted - Origins\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Phantom-Messages-Chilling-Letters-Emails/dp/1938875176/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Phantom Messages\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Truth-Proof-2-Beyond-Thinking-Mind-ebook/dp/B0791862LC/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 2: Beyond The Thinking Mind\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V3FKBK2/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Truth-Proof 3: Bringing Down the Light\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Night-People-Truth-Proof-Book-ebook/dp/B08CZJPSMZ/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Night People\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Village People","title":"Y.M.C.A.","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LZODXRW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LZODXRW"},{"artist":"Bee Gees","title":"Stayin Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01NBN2IS1/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01NBN2IS1"},{"artist":"Michael Jackson","title":"Thriller","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013D6LEM/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"Angry Young Man","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137RN7W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137RN7W"},{"artist":"Chic","title":"Le Freak","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001O7WD12/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001O7WD12"},{"artist":"Eddy Grant","title":"Electric Avenue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0CN9QDVQV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0CN9QDVQV"},{"artist":"Loverboy","title":"Working For The Weekend","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137TUC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137TUC8"},{"artist":"Beyoncé","title":"Single Ladies","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001KR1IBW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001KR1IBW"},{"artist":"Aerosmith","title":"Walk This Way","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPK2R3Z1/ctoc"},{"artist":"M/A/R/R/S","title":"Pump Up The Volume","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000SFV4SO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000SFV4SO"},{"artist":"Usher","title":"Yeah!","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073WN6RF5/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073WN6RF5"},{"artist":"Kool and The Gang","title":"Celebration","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZRA4S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZRA4S"},{"artist":"Cyndi Lauper","title":"Girls Just Want to Have Fun","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GLAM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GLAM"},{"artist":"The Weather Girls","title":"It's Raining Men","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137SX94/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137SX94"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F671194134da9535feb86b2c9","%2F5e9922c31f6a81c860bbc69a"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa959cdf86e46924b39110"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Connie Willis"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/hauntings","keywords/Dogman","keywords/cryptids"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef7ba4fb34deedc18a25","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef8da4fb34deedc18a26","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714ef9ca4fb34deedc18a27","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6714efb2a4fb34deedc18a28","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Oct 19 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A spooky concept of a ghostly figure silhouetted between trees in a forest on a moody, foggy winters day.

Thames asserted that her encounters were not dreams but real interactions where she was a willing participant. She rejected the notion that she was &quot;abducted&quot;, instead describing her experiences as beneficial interactions governed by &quot;soul contracts&quot;, or agreements made before her incarnation on Earth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thames recounted early memories of being taken aboard crafts by hybrid Greys, noting a deep bond with one particular female Grey. She then distinguished between different types of extraterrestrials while asserting that all share certain abilities. &quot;They are really all interdimensional beings,&quot; Thames clarified. Other entities she interacted with, often referred to as the Elders, were benevolent and luminescent creatures that transcended physical forms.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing their spacecrafts, Thames described how she found herself in a vast, sterile environment filled with different alien species. &quot;It's like you step into a whole new dimension,&quot; she said. On board the ship, Thames experienced what she called &quot;kundalini surges&quot;, or increases in energy that opened her subconscious. &quot;They did that to help us remember our soul history,&quot; she revealed, while also mentioning that both she and her son had undergone this awakening. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thames went on to explain the purpose of these ET interactions. &quot;They are reaching out to humanity... [and] want us to raise our frequency,&quot; she insisted. According to her, the most effective way to initiate this process is through intense focus. &quot;The best thing to do is to meditate with intention,&quot; Thames explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half featured Open Lines, where listeners call in to discuss topics of interest.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Chris from Ohio phoned in after a six-month hiatus and talked about microbiologists allegedly collaborating with Chinese scientists on coronavirus diseases 15 years ago. He also commended President Biden's recent apology to Indigenous peoples for historical injustices.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Craig in British Columbia praised the show's content and music. He raised a question about BRICS nations and their impact on global dynamics, suggesting a shift towards a multipolar world and the decline of the US dollar's dominance.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>George from California, a former NASA engineer, shared his perspective on the intersection of science and faith, expressing skepticism towards claims of communication with ETs. He warned of potential deception mentioned in the Bible, and encouraged everyone to clearly discern all spiritual experiences.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>James in Virginia spoke about the significance of the September 23, 2017 astrological event related to Revelation 12 in the Bible, claiming it marked a unique biblical sign. He expressed concern about how the Catholic Church interprets these signs and referenced a YouTube video that explores these themes in detail.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ron from Alaska pondered the possibility of undocumented migrants crossing the US-Mexico border having witnessed paranormal phenomena like Chupacabra, Bigfoot, or UFOs. He suggested that many interesting stories could emerge from interviews with these individuals.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Jose in Texas shared a personal experience of picking up a hitchhiker who he believed was a spirit or apparition, explaining that she vanished shortly after he dropped her off. He connected this encounter to the recent passing of his mother, suggesting it may have been a goodbye from her in a different spiritual form.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":""},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"John Lennon","title":"Slippin' And Slidin'","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0042UADGU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0042UADGU"},{"artist":"Acantha Lang","title":"He Said / She Said","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0C3MJVDW3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0C3MJVDW3"},{"artist":"Sheryl Crow","title":"Real Gone","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IEWR67U/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01IEWR67U"},{"artist":"Al Stewart","title":"Year of the Cat","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122OQ3W/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Five Times August","title":"Jesus, What Happened To Us?","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0928DRZW9/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Tanner Teague","title":"When It Pours","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DD6S5R8V/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DD6S5R8V"},{"artist":"George Harrison","title":"Give Me Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BV5GZ8CT/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BV5GZ8CT"},{"artist":"Dorothy Moore","title":"Misty Blue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07637HRVM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07637HRVM"},{"artist":"Rod Stewart","title":"Gasoline Alley","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V675BA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Bonnie Raitt","title":"Feels Like Home","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002KWHAOK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002KWHAOK"},{"artist":"Ashton, Gardener & Dyke","title":"The Resurrection Shuffle","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B006QYNN0S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B006QYNN0S"},{"artist":"John Prine","title":"Unlonely","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DH8N38SL/ctoc"},{"artist":"Joe Cocker","title":"Night Calls","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TEVHPE/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TE568I/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TE568I"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F65ea3aebb7fa6c70c3d92d93","%2F5dffc219cc137bf2442012a0"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/ET disclosure","keywords/contactee"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/671cd8f3f1734b428cd93cf0","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Oct 25 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671cd902f1734b428cd93cf1","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Oct 25 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671cd914f1734b428cd93cf2","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Oct 25 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671cd925f1734b428cd93cf3","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Oct 25 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A portrait of the head and upper torso of a yellow-green extra terrestrial being standing under a clear starry sky with some background haze.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

nationally syndicated program, \u003cem>Coast to Coast AM\u003c/em>, says if he weren&rsquo;t a  national radio talk show host he&rsquo;d be in politics. Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

On board the ship, Thames experienced what she called &quot;kundalini surges&quot;, or increases in energy that opened her subconscious. &quot;They did that to help us remember our soul history,&quot; she revealed, while also mentioning that both she and her son had undergone this awakening. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thames went on to explain the purpose of these ET interactions. &quot;They are reaching out to humanity... [and] want us to raise our frequency,&quot; she insisted. According to her, the most effective way to initiate this process is through intense focus. &quot;The best thing to do is to meditate with intention,&quot; Thames explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half featured Open Lines, where listeners call in to discuss topics of interest.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Chris from Ohio phoned in after a six-month hiatus and talked about microbiologists allegedly collaborating with Chinese scientists on coronavirus diseases 15 years ago. He also commended President Biden's recent apology to Indigenous peoples for historical injustices.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Craig in British Columbia praised the show's content and music.

Halloween is truly the time when the veil between our world and the other worlds is thinnest, she explained, emphasizing its roots in the pagan festival Samhain, which honors ancestors and the deceased. Signs of spirit activity may be on the rise during this time, she noted: &quot;Look for oddities,&quot; like flickering lights, strange sounds, or even changes in emotions, as ghosts represent a form of energy. She recounted a personal experience where she received a mysterious phone call from a deceased friend, illustrating how spirits can interact through technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Your intent is important in attracting positive spirits, Negri continued, suggesting simple rituals, like lighting a candle and sharing stories to invite positive energies. Addressing the importance of protection against negative energies, she recommended a &quot;mirrored bubble&quot; technique to reflect harmful intentions back to their source. A ritual is about &quot;creating sacred space,&quot; she shared, adding that rituals can range from daily practices like meditation to more elaborate ceremonies involving spirits, deities, or elements. She believes practitioners must adhere to a strong moral code, warning, &quot;There's going to be karma attached&quot; to negative actions. During the last hour, she offered readings to callers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://natureoflongevity.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Douglas Mulhall\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Psychic-Intuition-Everything-Wanted-Afraid/dp/1601632274/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Psychic Intuition\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Alien-Nancy-Tertre/dp/1632650215/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">How to Talk to an Alien\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Old-World-Magick-Modern-Techniques/dp/1733545506/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Old World Magick for the Modern World\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Dollcraft-Witchs-Poppet-Magick-Haunted/dp/073877748X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Dollcraft: A Witch's Guide to Poppet Magick &amp; Haunted Dolls\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Catalina","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0XNQS/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0XNQS"},{"artist":"Peter Paul & Mary","title":"Puff, The Magic Dragon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012EJGRG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012EJGRG"},{"artist":"Frank Zappa","title":"Peaches En Regalia","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00B2Z1G1Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00B2Z1G1Y"},{"artist":"Moody Blues","title":"I Know You’re Out There","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZU25E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZU25E"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"The Fox And The Lady","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01LD0YLVE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01LD0YLVE"},{"artist":"Frankie Avalon","title":"Venus","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IAO35EA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01IAO35EA"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"The Magnificent Seven","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EQRLWS2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EQRLWS2"},{"artist":"Talking Heads","title":"Take Me To The River","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001246EY4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001246EY4"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Push The Limits","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01IULESXA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01IULESXA"},{"artist":"Louis Armstrong","title":"What A Wonderful World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W1AFRA/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"David Holmes","title":"Pickpockets","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0026EEAEU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0026EEAEU"},{"artist":"Ozark Mountain Daredevils","title":"Jackie Blue","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W2185C/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":" Enigma","title":"Beyond The Invisible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073M1F88S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073M1F88S"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Softly As I Leave You","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00V07JYWC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00V07JYWC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e01134dcc137bf244202218","%2F5f766a37019c5bd3a50a0895"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/spirit communication","keywords/mediumship","keywords/aliens"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/671b757641815a47f7e6ed7f","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Oct 24 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671b758241815a47f7e6ed80","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Oct 24 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671b758f41815a47f7e6ed81","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Oct 24 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671b759e41815a47f7e6ed82","show":"coast","title":"Thu, Oct 24 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Alien, android, humanoid cyborg watching a holographic blue Earth planet floating over his hand.

He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

He posited that JFK's attempts to expose UFO interactions with the government were pivotal in the reason for his assassination and the coup d'état. &quot;I think...the intention to reveal the UFO presence and interaction with US government was the final nail in his coffin,&quot; he remarked, noting that Kennedy's efforts to dissolve the CIA's rogue actions and prevent nuclear proliferation were also factors. Expressing sympathy for Lee Harvey Oswald, whom he described as a patsy set up by larger forces, Morningstar suggested that he sacrificed his life for his country and was betrayed.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Studying &quot;hundreds of photographs, articles, documents,&quot; and CIA files, he concluded, &quot;the CIA hired the Chicago mafia to contract out the assassination of President Kennedy.&quot; Morningstar specifically named \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Files\" target=\"_blank\">James Files\u003c/a> as the shooter who fired the fatal bullet from the Grassy Knoll but indicated that there were &quot;four teams shooting&quot; that day, including French assassins brought in by the CIA. According to Morningstar, the Montauk Project in New York involved mind control experiments and the programming of assassins, including James Files, who'd been recruited into the program as a young boy. The CIA official, Cord Meyer, whom Morningstar associated with the New World Order, was the person tasked with starting the MK-ULTRA mind control program, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Author and angel researcher \u003ca href=\"https://catherinelanigan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Catherine Lanigan\u003c/a> believes that angels and celestial beings are vocal, especially now, in our current world situation. In the latter half, she explained that their messages, guidance, and warnings are clear: they are here to help us and that humanity is at a crossroads. She emphasized the importance of asking for angelic assistance, especially during tumultuous times when people are distressed. &quot;Humanity is being helped because there is so much fear and dark forces&quot; trying to overwhelm us, she stated. She encouraged listeners to &quot;command the angels to come in and help,&quot; asserting that many people are unaware of the support available to them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Touching on the battle between light and darkness, she warned that dark entities increasingly target those with the most light. They feed off our energy and keep us in fear, she revealed. She urged listeners to remain vigilant and connected to the divine, saying, &quot;We need to stay connected to the one source.&quot; Lanigan highlighted the impact of current solar flares, as well as the Schumann Resonance (electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere), as affecting people's mental health and raising anxiety. In addition to angels, extraterrestrials can offer help, she said, detailing how such beings assisted in healing her arm injuries. She also recalled her visit one night with 10,000 angels just before the pandemic began, and how they hovered just above the ground, and she sensed that a great challenge for humanity lay ahead.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>,\u003c/em>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Angel-Timelines-Catherine-Lanigan/dp/B0CX3MMBFY/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Angel Timelines\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Angel-Tales-Catherine-Lanigan/dp/1599559919/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Angel Tales\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Nudges-Tales-Angelic-Intervention/dp/075730298X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Divine Nudges\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Pisces","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01INYFLGM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01INYFLGM"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"More","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0048ZDIHK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0048ZDIHK"},{"artist":"Robert Plant","title":"In The Mood","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122OH0O/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122OH0O"},{"artist":"Fleetwood Mac","title":"Rhiannon","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00B22MJSG/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Guam","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01K6V4I00/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01K6V4I00"},{"artist":"Sam Cooke","title":"Cupid","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01CB0JBHO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01CB0JBHO"},{"artist":"Santana","title":"Black Magic Woman","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137GKW6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137GKW6"},{"artist":"Nat King Cole","title":"Unforgettable","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B01G7VSRQO"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Age Of Loneliness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB3JU/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB3JU"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"People Are Strange","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AO430/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AO430"},{"artist":"Blackalicious","title":"Swan Lake","url":"https://amazon.com/Swan-Lake-Blackalicious/dp/B000003LW3/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Rolling Stones","title":"Start Me Up","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002KVE1LQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Gravity Of Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCW7C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCW7C"},{"artist":"Judy Collins","title":"Send In The Clowns","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001226D3I/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e0073decc137bf244201aa8","%2F5dffdeb1cc137bf2442013b6"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/angel guidance","keywords/angels","keywords/JFK","keywords/UFOs","keywords/MK-Ultra"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/671a2a03bce8c7201b7f5e12","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Oct 23 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671a2a15bce8c7201b7f5e13","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Oct 23 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671a2a24bce8c7201b7f5e14","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Oct 23 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/671a2ababce8c7201b7f5e15","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Oct 23 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"A mystery concept of a hiker lost in a spooky winters forest.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

It's a lifestyle issue,&quot; he argued, claiming that the current medical model is failing to address chronic conditions effectively. &quot;One out of two Americans is going to get cancer at some time in their lifetime,&quot; Fuchs pointed out. He criticized the standard American diet, which he described as &quot;ridiculously obscene,&quot; noting that &quot;80% of calories come from ultra-processed foods.&quot; Fuchs believes that many health issues stem from &quot;over-nourishment and under-nutrition,&quot; urging listeners to reconsider their eating habits. He linked neuropathy — or inflammation of the nerves — to blood sugar issues. &quot;Your diagnosis doesn't matter. It's your biochemistry that counts,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Fuchs also underscored the importance of supplements, explaining, &quot;When you start to take nutritional supplements, you allow the body to access the energy from foods more effectively.&quot; On the topic of prescription medications, Fuchs expressed skepticism, saying, &quot;There's no prescription drug that you're taking for a long period of time that's going to make you better.&quot; He advised individuals to work with their doctors to wean off medications, emphasizing the need for transparency in doctor-patient relationships. &quot;We don't work for the doctor; the doctor works for us,&quot; he remarked.

Her journey from serving in the military to becoming a medium followed a personal tragedy: the unexpected passing of her stepdaughter, Susan, who was struck and killed by lightning. &quot;I just knew there had to be something more than this physical life,&quot; Giesemann reflected. The spiritual quest she embarked on revealed profound truths. &quot;When you discover that someone you love is not really gone, it changes everything,&quot; she explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Giesemann recounted a story of afterlife communication that involved a grieving mother meeting a man with a dog named Kevin, the same name as her deceased son. &quot;Have you ever heard of a dog named Kevin?&quot; she asked, while also asserting that &quot;there are no coincidences.&quot; Giesemann stressed the importance of personal exploration over blindly following rigid religious beliefs, stating, &quot;It's about finding out for yourself what is real and what is meaningful.&quot; She believes that everyone has access to spiritual guidance, even without tools like Ouija boards. &quot;We can learn to connect directly without using a game,&quot; she stated.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Lasee, a former Wisconsin state senator, emphasized that government oversight is restricting energy availability. &quot;They've used the regulatory environment to slowly constrict our energy supply,&quot; he claimed, arguing that this is also detrimental to the nation's food supply. Denying the mainstream narrative on climate change, Lasee pointed out the cyclical nature of weather events. He noted that the 1940s were the most active decade for hurricanes, countering claims that the most recent string of storms was unprecedented. &quot;They pretend as if this is new... it's certainly not,&quot; he remarked, while suggesting that the media propagates fear around climate issues. Lasee also highlighted the benefits of CO2, arguing that increased CO2 levels lead to better plant growth, which in turn enhances food security. &quot;We should be adding CO2... it's really super-airborne Miracle Grow,&quot; he stated.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lasee then accused proponents of climate change policies of manipulating data. According to him, a third of temperatures reported in the US are fabricated. Lasee also criticized the push for renewable energy, asserting that while wind and solar are promoted as cheaper alternatives, they are heavily subsidized and ultimately more expensive. &quot;The wind's not blowing 70% of the time,&quot; he noted, stressing the need for a reliable power source, which he believes coal and nuclear can provide.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also warned that the government-run transition to renewables is part of a larger agenda to control citizens' behavior. When asked about the motivations behind this agenda, Lasee suggested it involves &quot;trillions of dollars&quot; in investment and power-hungry elites.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, psychic medium \u003ca href=\"http://johnrussell.net/\" target=\"_blank\">John Russell\u003c/a> shared his journey into the world of the supernatural, beginning with a childhood encounter with a ghost at just five years old. &quot;It terrified the hell out of me,&quot; he recalled, but it opened a portal to his psychic abilities, enabling him to see into people's lives and futures. He described a pivotal moment when he accurately detailed a vacation that friends of his parents had taken, leaving them astonished. Russell emphasized the importance of a supportive environment, noting, &quot;My mother especially supported my abilities... her side of the family had a long and rich history with the paranormal.&quot; Russell also shared a humorous Halloween story from his childhood where he and a friend mistook a glowing cigarette for a ghost.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He then spoke about his experiences with haunted objects, particularly two cameras. &quot;All objects can be haunted... certain things do attract an intelligence, a spirit, or a power,&quot; he explained. The first camera began to exhibit paranormal activity during times of significant change and stress. He described a striking moment when it emitted a bright white flash despite it lacking this feature. &quot;That's definitely haunted, that's definitely supernatural,&quot; he insisted. Russell's second camera, a 35mm film camera, exhibited more unusual behavior. After attempting to capture a spirit photograph, he couldn't advance the film roll despite the device's indicators showing otherwise. Eventually the camera became completely inoperable, a sign of the spirit's refusal to be photographed. Beyond cameras, Russell mentioned he owns various other haunted objects, including rocks and dolls, and he believes they communicate valuable messages.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://vortex.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"http://drsky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Steve Kates aka Dr. Sky\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Crying-Tree-Magic-Rock/dp/197727756X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Crying Tree and the Magic Rock\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Riding-Ghosts-Angels-Spirits-Dead/dp/1977233287/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Riding with Ghosts, Angels, and the Spirits of the Dead\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Knock-Attic-Spine-chilling-Paranormal-Adventures/dp/1977239374/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">A Knock in the Attic\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM74C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM74C"},{"artist":"The Cyrkle","title":"Red Rubber Ball","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00HXHOZDQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Van Halen","title":"Right Now","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AOA8E/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Golden Earring","title":"Twilight Zone","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0070V6BCI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0070V6BCI"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Peter Dawson","title":"Waltzing Matilda","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B005GMN7KC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B005GMN7KC"},{"artist":"Styx","title":"Fooling Yourself","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NTZFO8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NTZFO8"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"Always On My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00138KIAU/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Turn Around","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TD98W4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TD98W4"},{"artist":"YES","title":"I've Seen All Good People","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00123K086/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00123K086"},{"artist":"Steely Dan","title":"Do It Again","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0BKRHBW32/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0BKRHBW32"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday on My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B06XKC7S9M/ctoc/?trackAsin=B06XKC7S9M"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"I Love You...

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Reflecting on her first pet, a rescue dog, she revealed that &quot;it was my empathy for Sylvester that not only saved him, but also saved me.&quot; This close emotional bond comforted Akhtar during a difficult time when she could directly relate to Sylvester's past abuse, allowing them both to heal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Akhtar addressed the historical misconceptions of animal consciousness, noting the primitive views of philosophers such as Aristotle and Descartes who dismissed animals as mere automatons. &quot;They absolutely are sentient... they feel love, sadness, loneliness, grief,&quot; she emphasized. &quot;It's pretty arrogant of us to think that only we are equipped with the ability to feel and think.&quot; This idea, she argued, has encouraged the scientific exploitation of animals, particularly in medical research where their suffering is often ignored for the sake of progress.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Akhtar went on to discuss animal mistreatment as a potential source of new pandemics, which she sees as karmic retribution. &quot;The ways in which we harm animals come back to hurt us... in a very real, tangible, medical way,&quot; she warned. &quot;Three-fourths of emerging or new infectious diseases are coming from other animals,&quot; explained Akhtar, who underscored the abhorrent sanitary conditions in factories and wildlife markets. She predicted that without more protective regulations, &quot;the next pandemic is going to stem from a factory farm.&quot; Akhtar described the horrific sights she witnessed during her visit to one of these establishments. &quot;Chickens were so tightly packed... they could barely turn around,&quot; she recalled, stating that the stench was overwhelming.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation also touched on the correlation between animal abuse and serial killers, as well as the transformative role that animals have when interacting with prison inmates.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"https://harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/stanley-milford-jr-86409\" target=\"_blank\">Stanley Milford Jr.\u003c/a> discussed how the paranormal became part of his job when he joined the Navajo Rangers — a law enforcement branch of the Navajo Nation who are police officers, conservationists, and historians. He recounted how he was thrust into the role of investigating supernatural phenomena during a case where an elderly woman claimed a Bigfoot stole her laundry. &quot;You may not understand these cases... but people are asking for help,&quot; he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Milford spoke candidly about his upbringing that straddled two cultures: Navajo and Cherokee. &quot;It was kind of a clash of two worlds,&quot; he noted. His experiences on the reservation informed his understanding of Navajo traditions, including the serious implications of witchcraft. He recalled a chilling encounter with a skinwalker, a shape-shifting entity. &quot;At that point, there was like ice water running through my veins,&quot; he shared. &quot;Shape-shifting... is a part of witchcraft, black witchcraft,&quot; he said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Milford also outlined the daunting task of enforcing the law with only eight officers available across the 27,000-square-mile Navajo reservation. &quot;You didn't have somebody standing there holding your hand,&quot; he recounted, before describing a harrowing manhunt for fugitives who killed a police officer. &quot;I spent the next month out there crawling in the river bottoms... learning what it meant to be a tactical operator,&quot; he recalled. Milford then went on to detail a bizarre investigation involving the mysterious deaths of 26 sheep. &quot;All of these sheep were dead, but you didn't see the telltale evidence of a predatory kill,&quot; he noted, describing how the sheep were precisely slit open and drained of all blood.

Mr. Haunted revealed that his fascination with the supernatural began in childhood. &quot;My mom loved thrillers, and my dad was huge on UFOs. They kind of started me off like this,&quot; Petonito recounted. He shared a chilling moment from his childhood, recalling how &quot;the radio started changing stations by itself... and something threw my legs down really hard on the bed.&quot; This incident sparked his lifelong quest to document the paranormal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Mr. Haunted, who has assisted in over 50 exorcisms, recounted how his professional journey really began when a chance encounter led him to share his ghost photographs with the Warrens, legendary figures in paranormal investigation. &quot;I started accumulating so many of these ghost pictures... and one day, a woman approached me saying, 'I work with Ed and Lorraine Warren. They would love to see these,'&quot; he recalled. &quot;I [then] had a phone conversation with Lorraine Warren that felt like we were best friends forever.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Petonito told listeners about a particularly harrowing exorcism where a woman he was recording would not stop screaming bloody murder. He said he documents these events to prove they're authentic. &quot;I don't lie, I don't embellish... this is what it is. There's no spinning heads,&quot; he swore.

He explained that extensive gamma and X-ray bombardment from supernovas are affecting the Sun's electromagnetic energy, which in turn is causing increased volcanic activity and natural disasters. According to Swerdlow, the recent hurricanes in Florida and North Carolina are not merely natural occurrences, but have been engineered using electromagnetic devices to target specific populations. &quot;There are those who have… manipulated them into stronger storms,&quot; he stated. Swerdlow also touched on the emerging threats from muons — particles that can penetrate human DNA. He expressed concern over increased muon bombardment and its potential effects on public health and the environment.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Swerdlow went on to discuss his unique role as an unofficial back channel between the US and Russian governments, stemming from his family history with the USSR. &quot;My great uncle Yakov Sverdlov was the first technical president of the Soviet Union,&quot; he told listeners. Swerdlow emphasized the urgency of deescalating nuclear threats, stating, &quot;If any NATO or American missiles strike within Russian territory, they would consider that an act of war.&quot; Addressing the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, Swerdlow predicted that it could conclude by Christmas of this year. He explained, &quot;People in the West do not understand history... Ukraine has always been considered the borderlands of Russia.&quot; He also discussed the concept of superstates emerging by 2025, where the US would control the Americas, Russia would oversee Europe and parts of Africa, and China would dominate East Asia. He predicted that &quot;it doesn't matter who wins the election... there's going to be a reshuffling of aspects around the world.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, author, clinical hypnotherapist, and founder of Dream-Life Coach Training, \u003ca href=\"http://www.kellysullivanwalden.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly Sullivan Walden\u003c/a> shared how to interpret magical dreams and unexplainable moments. &quot;All dreams count. They're all on the spectrum,&quot; she emphasized, highlighting the importance of both daydreams and nighttime visions. Walden recounted her early experiences with tandem dreaming alongside her sister, which she described as &quot;a very psychic bond.&quot; As a certified clinical hypnotherapist, Walden has observed that discussing dreams in therapy often accelerates healing, as &quot;the conscious mind... lies, but dreams don't.&quot; She also noted that &quot;there's no such thing as a bad dream,&quot; asserting that nightmares serve a purpose by helping us confront and correct imbalances in our lives.

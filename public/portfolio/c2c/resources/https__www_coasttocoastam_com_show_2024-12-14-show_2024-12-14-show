class="component-embed-html"><p>In the first half, Illinois State Director for MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network) <a href="http://illinoismufon.com/" target="_blank">Sam Maranto</a> joined guest host Rich Berra (<a href="mailto:richberra@coasttocoastam.com" target="_blank">email</a>) to discuss the correlation between the 2004 Tinley Park UFO mass sightings and other sightings during that timeframe. The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.</p>

<p>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.</p>

<p>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.</p>

<p>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.</p>

<p>---------------------</p>

<p>In the second half, researcher and writer <a href="https://fifthestatepub.com/" target="_blank">Joseph Lumpkin</a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.</p>

<p>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.</p>

<p>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.</p>

the first half, Illinois State Director for MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network) \u003ca href=\"http://illinoismufon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Maranto\u003c/a> joined guest host Rich Berra (\u003ca href=\"mailto:richberra@coasttocoastam.com\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss the correlation between the 2004 Tinley Park UFO mass sightings and other sightings during that timeframe. The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

One account involved a colleague, Mitch, who unknowingly brought a ghost home from a crime scene. Mitch, a CSI investigator, experienced electrical anomalies and observed his dog, Dude, behaving strangely—tracking invisible entities and reacting aggressively to an upstairs toilet. According to Rimmasch, a turning point occurred when a date, who was intuitive, confirmed the presence of a spirit in Mitch's house, identifying it as the young woman from the crime scene he had investigated. Mitch eventually accepted the presence, and though unsettling, it became a unique aspect of his life until he moved away.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Another story centered on Dexter, an extraordinary service dog who transformed the life of Mark, a retired police officer struggling with PTSD and severe night terrors. Initially abandoned, Dexter was trained as a service dog and instinctively began waking Mark during his nightmares, despite being told it was impossible to train dogs for such tasks. Mark realized that Dexter's interventions coincided with his distressing dreams, Rimmasch reported. This realization not only helped Mark manage his PTSD without medication but also reinforced the profound bond between them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rimmasch also commented on evidence rooms, which he revealed seem to attract unusual activity despite not being crime scenes themselves. He explained that once evidence from serious crimes, such as homicides, is brought into these rooms, strange phenomena sometimes begin to occur. These include unexplained noises, odd feelings, or other anomalies that people working in the evidence rooms have reported. Rimmasch suggested that these experiences might be tied to the energy or emotional weight of the items stored there, particularly those connected to traumatic events.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Next, psychic medium \u003ca href=\"https://coldcasepsychic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ericka Boussarhane\u003c/a> shared a deeply personal journey, highlighting the hereditary nature of her psychic abilities and how a kidney transplant amplified her sensitivities. She explained the concept of cellular memory, suggesting that organ transplants might transfer emotional memories and traits from donor to recipient, which could enhance abilities like hers. She also reflected on how specific organs, like the heart, may carry more emotional weight, citing scientific and anecdotal research.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhane discussed her approach to psychic abilities, emphasizing the role of the &quot;Clairs&quot;—clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, and more—as ways to perceive messages from loved ones or spiritual energies. She encouraged listeners to explore their latent psychic abilities through meditation, divination tools, and belief in their potential to connect with loved ones. She also touched on how memories and sensory triggers, like smells or vivid dreams, can serve as bridges to the spirit world, bringing comfort and peace.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhane addressed the challenges of being a psychic in a religious context, explaining how her strong faith integrates with her work. She spoke about using her abilities for healing and forensic purposes, assisting law enforcement, and helping individuals gain closure. She stressed the importance of humility and serving others rather than seeking personal gain. Boussarhane also gave psychic readings to callers.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guest: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sophiaurista/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Sophia Urista\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> talked about her new song, &quot;The City.&quot; \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fingerprints-Phantoms-Enforcement-Encounters-Paranormal/dp/0764355295/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Fingerprints and Phantoms\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Stones-Paul-Rimmasch/dp/1599558874/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Stones\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Mine-Paul-Rimmasch/dp/1937735591/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Mine\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sam-Boogie-Man-Ericka-Boussarhane/dp/1438931077/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Sam and the Boogie Man\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://psychicdiva.thinkific.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Psychic &amp; Intuitive Development Course\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://psychicdiva.thinkific.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Psychic and Mediumship Development Course\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NSZLFC/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sophia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08BDN6VCV/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Cat People","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001Q1QC4K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001Q1QC4K"},{"artist":"Red Rider","title":"Lunatic Fringe","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000ULCSAY/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000ULCSAY"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"People Are Strange","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AO430/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AO430"},{"artist":"The Highwaymen","title":"Highwayman","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136S1F6/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Zach Bryan","title":"Something In The Orange","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09YGSPVPJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Sturgill Simpson","title":"In Bloom","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01C9VPVEM/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01C9VPVEM"},{"artist":"Led Zeppelin","title":"When The Levee Breaks","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00M320GZW/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Gordon Lightfoot","title":"If You Could Read My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002YSN22E/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"MGMT","title":"Kids","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0013873K8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0013873K8"},{"artist":"Niall Horan","title":"This Town","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01M0X2A3D/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Nirvana","title":"Come As You Are","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B005MVLJ48/ctoc/?trackAsin=B005MVLJ48"},{"artist":"No Doubt ","title":"It's My Life","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V61610/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000V61610"},{"artist":"Oingo Boingo","title":"Just Another Day","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NTPDK4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NTPDK4"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Inca-Dance/dp/B07P19JR8X/ctoc"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00fd81cc137bf2442020f1","%2F61e0c6eb59be0b249eb59caf"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/law enforcement","keywords/forensics","keywords/organ transplants","keywords/service dog"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6766b2378add4e7c5088f5b2","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Dec 20 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6766b2498add4e7c5088f5b3","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Dec 20 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6766b2588add4e7c5088f5b4","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Dec 20 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6766b2698add4e7c5088f5b5","show":"coast","title":"Fri, Dec 20 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"SYDNEY, NSW - MAY 18:  Leigh Sheppard, a PHD student in Ceramic Engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) views a tiO2 photo-electrode used in an experiment to produce hydrogen from water and light May 18, 2005 in Sydney Australia.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.

Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, Illinois State Director for MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network) \u003ca href=\"http://illinoismufon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Maranto\u003c/a> joined guest host Rich Berra (\u003ca href=\"mailto:richberra@coasttocoastam.com\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss the correlation between the 2004 Tinley Park UFO mass sightings and other sightings during that timeframe. The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

the first half, Illinois State Director for MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network) \u003ca href=\"http://illinoismufon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Maranto\u003c/a> joined guest host Rich Berra (\u003ca href=\"mailto:richberra@coasttocoastam.com\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss the correlation between the 2004 Tinley Park UFO mass sightings and other sightings during that timeframe. The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

the first half, Illinois State Director for MUFON (The Mutual UFO Network) \u003ca href=\"http://illinoismufon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Maranto\u003c/a> joined guest host Rich Berra (\u003ca href=\"mailto:richberra@coasttocoastam.com\" target=\"_blank\">email\u003c/a>) to discuss the correlation between the 2004 Tinley Park UFO mass sightings and other sightings during that timeframe. The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on?

One account involved a colleague, Mitch, who unknowingly brought a ghost home from a crime scene. Mitch, a CSI investigator, experienced electrical anomalies and observed his dog, Dude, behaving strangely—tracking invisible entities and reacting aggressively to an upstairs toilet. According to Rimmasch, a turning point occurred when a date, who was intuitive, confirmed the presence of a spirit in Mitch's house, identifying it as the young woman from the crime scene he had investigated. Mitch eventually accepted the presence, and though unsettling, it became a unique aspect of his life until he moved away.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Another story centered on Dexter, an extraordinary service dog who transformed the life of Mark, a retired police officer struggling with PTSD and severe night terrors. Initially abandoned, Dexter was trained as a service dog and instinctively began waking Mark during his nightmares, despite being told it was impossible to train dogs for such tasks. Mark realized that Dexter's interventions coincided with his distressing dreams, Rimmasch reported. This realization not only helped Mark manage his PTSD without medication but also reinforced the profound bond between them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rimmasch also commented on evidence rooms, which he revealed seem to attract unusual activity despite not being crime scenes themselves. He explained that once evidence from serious crimes, such as homicides, is brought into these rooms, strange phenomena sometimes begin to occur. These include unexplained noises, odd feelings, or other anomalies that people working in the evidence rooms have reported. Rimmasch suggested that these experiences might be tied to the energy or emotional weight of the items stored there, particularly those connected to traumatic events.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Next, psychic medium \u003ca href=\"https://coldcasepsychic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ericka Boussarhane\u003c/a> shared a deeply personal journey, highlighting the hereditary nature of her psychic abilities and how a kidney transplant amplified her sensitivities. She explained the concept of cellular memory, suggesting that organ transplants might transfer emotional memories and traits from donor to recipient, which could enhance abilities like hers. She also reflected on how specific organs, like the heart, may carry more emotional weight, citing scientific and anecdotal research.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhane discussed her approach to psychic abilities, emphasizing the role of the &quot;Clairs&quot;—clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, and more—as ways to perceive messages from loved ones or spiritual energies. She encouraged listeners to explore their latent psychic abilities through meditation, divination tools, and belief in their potential to connect with loved ones.

He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

href=\"https://facebook.com/people/fingerprints-and-phantoms/100065049488724\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Rimmasch\u003c/a> who shared intriguing observations about paranormal experiences in law enforcement. One account involved a colleague, Mitch, who unknowingly brought a ghost home from a crime scene. Mitch, a CSI investigator, experienced electrical anomalies and observed his dog, Dude, behaving strangely—tracking invisible entities and reacting aggressively to an upstairs toilet. According to Rimmasch, a turning point occurred when a date, who was intuitive, confirmed the presence of a spirit in Mitch's house, identifying it as the young woman from the crime scene he had investigated. Mitch eventually accepted the presence, and though unsettling, it became a unique aspect of his life until he moved away.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Another story centered on Dexter, an extraordinary service dog who transformed the life of Mark, a retired police officer struggling with PTSD and severe night terrors. Initially abandoned, Dexter was trained as a service dog and instinctively began waking Mark during his nightmares, despite being told it was impossible to train dogs for such tasks. Mark realized that Dexter's interventions coincided with his distressing dreams, Rimmasch reported. This realization not only helped Mark manage his PTSD without medication but also reinforced the profound bond between them.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rimmasch also commented on evidence rooms, which he revealed seem to attract unusual activity despite not being crime scenes themselves. He explained that once evidence from serious crimes, such as homicides, is brought into these rooms, strange phenomena sometimes begin to occur. These include unexplained noises, odd feelings, or other anomalies that people working in the evidence rooms have reported. Rimmasch suggested that these experiences might be tied to the energy or emotional weight of the items stored there, particularly those connected to traumatic events.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------------------------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Next, psychic medium \u003ca href=\"https://coldcasepsychic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ericka Boussarhane\u003c/a> shared a deeply personal journey, highlighting the hereditary nature of her psychic abilities and how a kidney transplant amplified her sensitivities. She explained the concept of cellular memory, suggesting that organ transplants might transfer emotional memories and traits from donor to recipient, which could enhance abilities like hers. She also reflected on how specific organs, like the heart, may carry more emotional weight, citing scientific and anecdotal research.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhane discussed her approach to psychic abilities, emphasizing the role of the &quot;Clairs&quot;—clairvoyance, clairaudience, clairsentience, and more—as ways to perceive messages from loved ones or spiritual energies. She encouraged listeners to explore their latent psychic abilities through meditation, divination tools, and belief in their potential to connect with loved ones. She also touched on how memories and sensory triggers, like smells or vivid dreams, can serve as bridges to the spirit world, bringing comfort and peace.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Boussarhane addressed the challenges of being a psychic in a religious context, explaining how her strong faith integrates with her work. She spoke about using her abilities for healing and forensic purposes, assisting law enforcement, and helping individuals gain closure. She stressed the importance of humility and serving others rather than seeking personal gain.

Dr. Willeumier highlighted the uniqueness of each person's brain chemistry, saying that &quot;every case is different… due to environmental factors or genetic factors.&quot; She underscored the significance of staying active both physically and mentally, pointing to studies that link physical activity with increased blood flow to the brain, which helps preserve cognitive function. &quot;Staying cognitively engaged and physically active… can really help slow down or reduce our risk of dementia,&quot; she insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation then shifted to dietary influences on brain health. Dr. Willeumier recommended the Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. &quot;Berries have been shown to really help support healthy brain function,&quot; she noted, adding that foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as fatty fish and walnuts, also promote cognitive well-being.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Dr. Willeumier shared other practical tips for improving brain health, including engaging in mindfulness practices, reducing processed food intake, and managing stress, which can lead to shrinkage of key brain areas. &quot;Stress can shrink brain volume in the prefrontal cortex… which is essential for higher cognitive functioning,&quot; she warned. Dr. Willeumier also touched on the future of neurotechnology, specifically Neuralink's brain-computer interface. &quot;These technologies could really transform the way we look at what is possible with the brain,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Sleep was another crucial topic. Dr. Willeumier explained that restorative sleep is vital for memory consolidation and emotional regulation. Throughout the rest of the interview, she provided listeners with more tangible strategies to &quot;biohack&quot; their brains. &quot;Practicing gratitude, taking brisk walks, and even enjoying a piece of dark chocolate can promote brain health,&quot; she advised.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, animal communicator \u003ca href=\"https://ameliakinkade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amelia Kinkade\u003c/a> shared stories of reincarnated animals coming back to the humans they love. &quot;Everywhere I go, 75% of hands go up when I ask if people feel their pets have reincarnated,&quot; she shared. Kinkade recounted a story about a veterinarian's deceased cat who communicated details of her own death, and even described a future incarnation. &quot;[Beings] can actually negotiate reincarnation,&quot; Kinkade noted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>A significant theme of the conversation was the innate intuition that all humans possess. &quot;There's no sixth sense; it's our first sense. We all have the capability to connect deeply with other beings,&quot; Kinkade stated. She emphasized that animal behavior often reflects human emotional states, saying, &quot;If a person is upset, the animal mirrors that emotion—it's a deep spiritual practice.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She also described her late chocolate Persian cat's reincarnation, which she encountered during a safari in Africa. &quot;I had a vision of a lioness asking for my blessing for her cub,&quot; Kinkade said. Later on that same trip, she met the cub from her vision and realized her cat had returned. &quot;He's come home to Africa, and he's changed species, but it's still him,&quot; she asserted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She encouraged listeners to embrace their connections with animals, explaining that they serve as guides and healers. &quot;Your animal is your spirit guide,&quot; she explained. &quot;They don't leave you forever.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Ubaney has spent over a decade researching Elvis's untimely demise, and he began the conversation by recounting the star's humble beginnings in Tupelo, Mississippi, where Presley was born into poverty. &quot;Elvis was dirt, dirt poor... they were eating three-day-old food,&quot; Ubaney explained. As Elvis's career took off, so did the influence of his manager, Colonel Tom Parker. &quot;[Parker] was arguably the best and worst thing that ever happened to him,&quot; Ubaney stated, explaining how the financially manipulative manager helped elevate Elvis from a regional act to a national superstar.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ubaney expressed skepticism about the official narrative regarding Elvis's death. &quot;From day one, I never believed what they said,&quot; he claimed. He pointed out that Elvis had undergone two comprehensive physicals shortly before his passing, which found no alarming issues. The conversation turned to the musician's rampant drug use and the financial pressures he faced, with Ubaney revealing that the singer and his manager were essentially bankrupt. &quot;Colonel Parker owed $32 million... the pressure was mounting,&quot; he explained. Ubaney described how Elvis sought the protection of the FBI, wanting to become a federal narcotics agent to combat threats he had been receiving, particularly from the mob, which Parker was allegedly involved with.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ubaney went on to suggest that Elvis's death was not a simple overdose but rather a murder orchestrated against the backdrop of Parker's gambling debts and mob connections. &quot;I do believe Elvis knew his assailants,&quot; he stated. &quot;When Elvis died, Colonel Parker owed millions... it was not going to end well.&quot; Ubaney dismissed the popular story that Elvis died on the toilet, asserting, &quot;Elvis was never on the toilet... they tackled Elvis from behind.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Ubaney then pointed to inconsistencies in the autopsy reports, mentioning two death certificates—one citing cardiac arrhythmia and the other asphyxiation. He also connected Elvis's fascination with the JFK assassination to his own untimely demise, revealing that both he and JFK investigator William Sullivan died shortly after attempting to uncover the truth.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, paranormal researcher and spirit communicator \u003ca href=\"http://creativevisionspublications.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Karen A. Dahlman\u003c/a> discussed her journey with channeling and Ouija boards. Dahlman, who has been channeling since childhood, explained that it is a way to access information from various sources, including spirit guides and one's higher self. &quot;We're all channeling all the time,&quot; she noted. She also highlighted the significance of intention in channeling, saying, &quot;The energy you put out is the energy you attract back.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the popularity of Ouija boards, Dahlman described them as both collectibles and tools for accessing divine wisdom. &quot;They have a rich history... and they allow me to bring through divine wisdom and consciousness from other spiritual beings,&quot; she explained. When asked how someone could start channeling, she advised creating a relaxed environment and setting intentions to connect with one's higher self. &quot;Get into a self-hypnosis state... open up your heart and say, I would like to channel my divine wisdom,&quot; she recommended. Dahlman emphasized the importance of maintaining a positive mindset to attract beneficial energy, stating, &quot;You must get into a space of, 'I'm open, I'm positive.'&quot; \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She emphasized that this time of year, with celebrations such as Christmas and Hanukkah, creates a &quot;raising of energy&quot; that individuals can tap into. &quot;Why not ride that wave of greatness, of merriment, of joy?&quot; she suggested. Dahlman, who is also an officer of the Talking Board Historical Society, shared insights on the history of Ouija boards, tracing their origins back to 1886. She recounted a fascinating anecdote about President Grover Cleveland, who received a &quot;witch board&quot; as a wedding gift.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>When discussing the nature of channeling, Dahlman noted that &quot;enlightenment is a process,&quot; and that everyone can access divine wisdom through their own experiences.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

She pointed out the importance of small banks, arguing, &quot;The more small banks you have, the more you can produce growth without inflation,&quot; and criticized the consolidation of the banking system, which has seen a decline from 15,000 banks to just over 4,000. On the topic of cryptocurrency, she voiced skepticism about its current trajectory, suggesting that Bitcoin has been &quot;hijacked&quot; for speculative purposes. &quot;What could have been a really great global payment system&quot; has turned into a tool for pump and dump schemes, she lamented.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>&quot;The government has been in serious violation of financial management laws for many years,&quot; she continued. Fitts expressed concern over the increasing control central banks are seeking through digital currencies: &quot;If we go to an all-digital monetary system, we're looking at the ability for the central bankers to control it.&quot; She described this potential shift as a &quot;financial coup,&quot; where fiscal policies could be manipulated without public representation. Financial freedom, the ability to transact without interference, would likely be compromised by a fully digital system that could lead to invasive surveillance and control over our personal finances, she further cautioned.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, near-death experiencer \u003ca href=\"https://dannion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dannion Brinkley\u003c/a> shared his profound near-death encounters and the insights he gained from them. He has survived multiple brushes with death, including being struck by lightning twice and enduring extensive surgeries. He recounted the lightning strikes that happened to him in the 1970s, revealing that both incidents occurred while he was on the phone during a storm. He described some of the mystical aspects of his near-death experiences (NDEs), including a painful &quot;panoramic life review&quot; where he felt the impact of his actions on others, saying, &quot;I had to become every person that I'd ever encountered and feel the direct results of my interaction.&quot; Realizing he could do much better in his interactions, the NDE acted as a catalyst for significant personal transformations in his life.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During his NDEs, he also received prophetic visions, some of which he believes will possibly play out in 2025, including solar flares. He also saw a &quot;battle for the souls of humankind&quot; in healthcare, emphasizing the need for compassion and closure for those nearing the end of life. &quot;You take a breath when you come here, and you let a breath out when you leave,&quot; he remarked, highlighting the transient nature of life and the importance of learning from our experiences. Through his \u003ca href=\"http://help.thetwilightbrigade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Twilight Brigade\u003c/a> organization, Brinkley has been a hospice volunteer for 40 years, attending to hundreds of vets at the end of their lives.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

Mantik, a radiation oncologist with a PhD in physics, analyzed JFK's autopsy X-rays and concluded that all three of the ones in the archives had been falsified &quot;to hide evidence of frontal shots,&quot; Corsi stated, asserting that there were clear indications of shots fired from the Grassy Knoll. Corsi expressed confidence that the release of classified documents, which could happen during the next Trump administration, will reveal more about the assassination. &quot;The final documents will show that Lee Harvey Oswald was working for the CIA,&quot; he said, adding that, &quot;I don't believe Lee Harvey Oswald fired a single shot that day.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The discussion also touched on the concept of the &quot;Deep State,&quot; which Corsi characterized as a group of unelected officials and bureaucrats making decisions and controlling power behind the scenes. He implicated intelligence agencies in the cover-up of JFK's assassination, suggesting they manipulate public perception and control narratives. Further, Corsi believes the CIA was &quot;deeply involved in killing Jack Kennedy&quot; and acted in a conspiracy with organized crime to carry it out. Discussing Robert Kennedy, he thinks that RFK was aware of the conspiracy and, if he had lived, would have pursued the truth about his brother's assassination. Corsi posited that former CIA director Allen Dulles, after being dismissed by President Kennedy, began plotting revenge against him.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author, researcher, and ufologist \u003ca href=\"https://ufocurrents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Anthony Sanchez\u003c/a> offered commentary and analysis on the state of ufology and the recent UFO/UAP hearings. He has stirred controversy within the UFO community by posing provocative questions about the current UAP narrative, suggesting it could be a &quot;psyop&quot; orchestrated by defense industries. He also shared concern over the motives behind the mainstream media's focus on UAPs, pondering whether this was a tactic to manage public perception and justify expanded government control. The current drone mystery could be part of that agenda, he added.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Regarding the congressional hearings, &quot;the major revelations in 2023 were the confirmation of non-human biologics associated with UAPs,&quot; he said, as well as the riveting testimony of retired naval pilot David Fravor on the 2004 &quot;Tic Tac&quot; incident aboard the USS Nimitz. Sanchez contrasted that with the 2024 hearings, which he felt lacked the same level of impact, with the focus shifting towards integrating discovered technologies into national security frameworks. The hearings may serve as a kind of &quot;grand pageantry&quot; to excite and distract the public while pushing hidden agendas, he remarked.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He highlighted the government's typical response to UFO sightings, which often downplays the significance of these events. Their pattern, he said, has repeated throughout the UFO phenomenon since 1947: &quot;Go away, people. There's nothing to be seen here.&quot; He pondered whether the current drone phenomenon (such as mysterious \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/drones-new-jersey-what-to-know-e6f565f5d51d9d47ad140e7e7d131842\" target=\"_blank\">sightings over NJ\u003c/a>) could be a test of public reaction, suggesting that non-human intelligence might be observing human responses to these ambiguous situations.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thompson emphasized the need to reassess the terminology surrounding UFOs, noting that the shift from &quot;UFO&quot; to &quot;UAP&quot; (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) was an attempt by the Pentagon to distance itself from the stigma associated with extraterrestrial life. He pointed out that &quot;UFO means unidentified flying object,&quot; yet the term has become conflated with extraterrestrial narratives, limiting our understanding of the phenomenon. He also touched on the cultural implications of UFOs, stating, &quot;The deeper you dig into it, the wider the discussion gets.&quot; He urged listeners to consider the broader historical context, hinting at connections between UFOs and ancient myths, as explored in Jacques Vallee's work.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Drawing parallels between UFO experiences and shamanic traditions, he compared some UFO encounters to unusual states of consciousness, like a near-death experience he had in Hawaii. In comprehending the topic, he advocated for thinking beyond conventional boundaries. &quot;Some of what were called UFOs are probably interdimensional rather than extraterrestrial,&quot; he continued. Addressing his influence on Dr. John Mack, the late Harvard psychiatrist who studied alien abduction phenomena, Mack told Thompson that if he had not read his book \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201550849/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Angels &amp; Aliens\u003c/a> (published in 1991), he might not have gone down the road of delving into the subject.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Thompson spoke about his research into the 1994 Ariel School incident in Zimbabwe, where over 60 children reported an encounter with extraterrestrial beings, and the profound psychological impact of this experience that followed some of the witnesses into adulthood, such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.timesnownews.com/world/emily-trim-woman-who-saw-aliens-in-infamous-ariel-school-incident-has-died-article-115784642\" target=\"_blank\">Emily Trim\u003c/a>.

The Tinley Park event, which occurred on August 21, 2004 in the Chicago metro area, is one of the most significant cases Maranto has investigated. On that night, numerous witnesses reported seeing three reddish-orange lights in a triangular formation floating silently across the sky. &quot;We had over 100 people seeing the same event simultaneously,&quot; Maranto explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He noted that the phenomenon was not limited to Illinois; similar sightings were reported across several states and even in Australia shortly afterward. Maranto dismissed the idea that the lights could be attributed to military drones or flares. He pointed out the absence of air traffic during the sighting, which heightened the mystery as this was unusual for the busy Chicagoland area. &quot;People were alarmed... they were thinking possible terrorists,&quot; he revealed, given that the event happened just under 3 years after the 9-11 attacks.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Maranto likened this sighting to the famous Phoenix Lights incident, pointing out the similarities of large triangular shapes and the presence of additional orbs. &quot;There were multiple objects seen... there were orbs that detached and came out of the main object,&quot; he remarked. Maranto speculated on the nature of these phenomena, suggesting they could be interdimensional or extraterrestrial in origin. &quot;If you can control gravity, you're going to be able to manipulate time and space,&quot; he explained, indicating that the technology behind these sightings could be far beyond our current understanding.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Discussing the potential implications of these sightings, Maranto noted, &quot;It's a matter of national security at that point.&quot; He also expressed concern that these objects could be advanced military technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, researcher and writer \u003ca href=\"https://fifthestatepub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Lumpkin\u003c/a> explored lost and rejected scriptures, including the Book of Enoch. Lumpkin claimed these obscure texts have a lot to offer Christians, despite being cast aside by a majority of denominations. He speculated that the Book of Enoch, written around 300 BC, was deemed &quot;too fanciful&quot; by early church fathers, leading them to categorize it as apocryphal.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin characterized the Book of Enoch as an elaborate Midrash, a form of interpretation that provides deeper context to biblical narratives. &quot;It's almost like the director's cut of Genesis,&quot; he remarked. The conversation ventured into the nature of the Watchers, angels mentioned in Enoch who descended to Earth and interacted with humanity. Lumpkin proposed that these beings may have attempted to create a &quot;race of Messiah&quot;, which he described as &quot;Christ-like people.&quot; He posited that the Great Flood served as a reset button for this experiment, as Noah's family was the only one untainted by the Watchers' influence.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Lumpkin also asserted that stories of miraculous births and resurrections were not unique to Jesus but shared among various cultures. He lamented the exclusion of certain texts like the Book of Enoch from mainstream biblical canon, stating, &quot;Do you really think that God said less as time goes on? No, we keep cutting things out.&quot; He noted that the Ethiopian Orthodox Church still includes these texts, broadening their canon to 81 books, a stark contrast to the 66 books found in Protestant Bibles. &quot;When you're in seminary, sometimes you're more indoctrinated than you are educated,&quot; Lumpkin noted.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Books-Enoch-Watchers-Extensive-Commentary/dp/195845009X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Books of Enoch\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Book-Giants-Watchers-Nephilim-Enoch/dp/1936533499/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Book of Giants\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Books-Bible-Great-Rejected/dp/193653357X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Lost Books of the Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Kenny Wayne Shepherd","title":"Blue On Black","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002B2U6TU/ctoc"},{"artist":"Sofia Urista","title":"The City","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im43QBZVOsc"},{"artist":"Prince","title":"Sign O' The Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08Q8SDHRJ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Madonna","title":"Live to Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122FX5C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122FX5C"},{"artist":"Manfred Mann's Earth Band","title":"Spirits In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01N4RTMXK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01N4RTMXK"},{"artist":"Marvin Gaye","title":"Mercy Mercy Me","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B08T5HSY2K/ctoc/?trackAsin=B08T5HSY2K"},{"artist":"Milky Chance","title":"Stolen Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01MUD1GQ3/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01MUD1GQ3"},{"artist":"The Moody Blues","title":"The Voice","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NZR8PG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NZR8PG"},{"artist":"Morrissey","title":"Suedehead","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00INFISS0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00INFISS0"},{"artist":"Neil Diamond","title":"Solitary Man","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XHXHXL5/ctoc"},{"artist":"Spacehog","title":"In the Meantime","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0012323YA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0012323YA"},{"artist":"Pat Benatar","title":"Invincible","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003XB9M6G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003XB9M6G"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Yellow Ledbetter","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00136PTZ6/ctoc"},{"artist":"Pink Floyd","title":"Goodbye Blue Sky","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B019HKKHD8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B019HKKHD8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e00120acc137bf24420163c","%2F673fc7462af70241c82edcd3"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6634e952fd5158c4fe5b1712"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Rich Berra"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/UFOs","keywords/Tinley Park","keywords/mass sightings","keywords/Bible","keywords/scriptures"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ece93ba539737579d314b","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecea2ba539737579d314c","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675eceb3ba539737579d314d","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/675ecec3ba539737579d314e","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Dec 14 2024 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"An old-style UFO hovers over forest.

Rojas believes that while the government holds secrets about UAP, the biggest secret may be their own uncertainty. &quot;I think they know less than people assume they do,&quot; he speculated. Rojas also expressed frustration over the lack of transparency from the government and academics, stating, &quot;There just doesn't seem to be that motivation in the scientific community [for disclosure].&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rojas also touched on the confusion surrounding the terms UFO and UAP, noting that &quot;UAP represents the scientific investigation of UFOs,&quot; but the public often misunderstands this distinction. As for the recent reports of drones over New Jersey and elsewhere, he proposed that many of these incidents are likely misidentified aircraft. Rojas urged for more rigorous analysis of such reports, which is what he strives for at his company Enigma Labs. &quot;What we're doing at Enigma is to analyze these reports and get to the bottom of them,&quot; he explained.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Rojas continued to emphasize the need for verifiable data over anecdotal stories: &quot;Now we need hard data—and we can get the hard data—we just gotta do the hard work.&quot; He highlighted two compelling incidents, the first being the Aguadilla, Puerto Rico case from 2013, where a mysterious object was filmed by border security officers. Despite being dismissed by the Department of Defense as possibly a balloon or birds, Rojas noted, &quot;what's weird about this object is at the end of the video, it breaks into two.&quot; Another case involved a bright light over Signal Mountain, Texas, where the eerie illumination started moving in weird, inexplicable ways.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The third hour featured afterlife expert \u003ca href=\"http://wedontdie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandra Champlain\u003c/a>, who shared her experience and wisdom on the dying process. Following the death of her father, Sandra's long-held fear of dying spurred her to seek proof of what lies beyond, a pursuit she described as &quot;a secret journey&quot; that ultimately became her life's work. Although initially raised in a household that emphasized &quot;seeing is believing,&quot; Sandra recounted a pivotal moment where she overcame skepticism and realized her own abilities. While attending a workshop on mediumship, she was able to accurately describe another participant's deceased grandfather—a Danish fisherman who smoked heavily—which amazed everyone there.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>This experience encouraged her to continue exploring various facets of afterlife communication, including Electronic Voice Phenomena and near-death experiences. &quot;I have studied so much that has 100% proved to me that not only do we go on, but that who we are as human beings is pretty magical,&quot; she insisted. Champlain explained how death is merely &quot;closing our eyes to this world and opening them again.&quot; She expressed excitement about the prospect of meeting deceased loved ones in the afterlife, who often appear as &quot;young and healthy&quot; during deathbed visions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Champlain encouraged listeners to remain open-minded, challenging the notion of a singular truth regarding life and death. &quot;There's more to life than meets the eye,&quot; she said.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>---------------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The final hour of the program featured Open Lines, where listeners called in to discuss topics of interest. Cornelius from Louisiana discussed the mental health struggles faced by veterans, especially during the holidays. He emphasized the importance of community support and thanked the show for helping him cope with his father's passing.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Angel from St. Louis shared a dramatic encounter from 1969 while crossing the Courtney Campbell Causeway. He described witnessing a massive craft overhead that was loud enough to drown out screams. Jack from South Carolina spoke about his connection with his deceased ancestors through genealogy.

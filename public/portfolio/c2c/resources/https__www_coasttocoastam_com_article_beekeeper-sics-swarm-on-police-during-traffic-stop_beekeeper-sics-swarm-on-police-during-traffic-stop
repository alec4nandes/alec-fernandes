the first half, author and military historian \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/forstchen-william-r-38799/\" target=\"_blank\">William R. Forstchen\u003c/a> discussed the potential threats posed by electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks and solar flares, the possibility of America building a protective &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; and the current geopolitical landscape. Known for his novel &quot;One Second After,&quot; he provided a stark overview of EMPs-- an electromagnetic pulse weapon (such as a small atomic bomb) that can disrupt or damage electronic equipment. &quot;The worst case attack would be three such weapons over Eastern, Central, and Western United States, 200 miles above the earth,&quot; he detailed. &quot;When the weapon blows, it sets up an electrostatic discharge, and a gamma ray discharged from the explosion...literally, one second after this, the country goes dark.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Forstchen also described solar flares, or coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as a constant threat, stating, &quot;Once in a while, a CME will cut loose and come straight at us.&quot; He referenced the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused significant damage to telegraph systems, warning that a similar event today could be disastrous given our reliance on technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation shifted to defense strategies, particularly President Trump's proposal for a &quot;Golden Dome&quot; missile defense system, which Forstchen supports as a necessary strategic defense against EMP threats. He stated, &quot;Golden Dome is designed to hit enemy missiles long before they hit over the United States,&quot; somewhat akin to Israel's Iron Dome system, and is estimated to cost around $25 billion over 10 years. He touched on global issues, including North Korea's current restraint, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and Iran's nuclear ambitions. Forstchen also expressed excitement about the upcoming film adaptation of his book &quot;One Second After,&quot; which will be shot in Bulgaria.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and near-death experiencer \u003ca href=\"https://www.pegfields.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peg Fields\u003c/a> shared her profound experiences with out-of-body phenomena, energy healing, and spirit contact, tracing these abilities back to her childhood. Her journey into massage therapy emerged as a healing vocation, where she instinctively helped clients by connecting with their energy. &quot;I just feel like my heart and my being reaches out to the other person,&quot; she explained. Fields emphasized the importance of addressing not just physical ailments but also the energetic and spiritual aspects of healing.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One poignant story involved a client haunted by a spirit named Harold for three years, leading to what Fields described as a &quot;deletion&quot; or &quot;transformation&quot; that ultimately freed the woman from her distress. She also detailed an encounter with a skeptical man at her book signing, who ended up deeply moved when she connected him with a deceased relative. She recalled, &quot;I said, 'Did she have a head injury?'

From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

the first half, author and military historian \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/forstchen-william-r-38799/\" target=\"_blank\">William R. Forstchen\u003c/a> discussed the potential threats posed by electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks and solar flares, the possibility of America building a protective &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; and the current geopolitical landscape. Known for his novel &quot;One Second After,&quot; he provided a stark overview of EMPs-- an electromagnetic pulse weapon (such as a small atomic bomb) that can disrupt or damage electronic equipment. &quot;The worst case attack would be three such weapons over Eastern, Central, and Western United States, 200 miles above the earth,&quot; he detailed. &quot;When the weapon blows, it sets up an electrostatic discharge, and a gamma ray discharged from the explosion...literally, one second after this, the country goes dark.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Forstchen also described solar flares, or coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as a constant threat, stating, &quot;Once in a while, a CME will cut loose and come straight at us.&quot; He referenced the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused significant damage to telegraph systems, warning that a similar event today could be disastrous given our reliance on technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation shifted to defense strategies, particularly President Trump's proposal for a &quot;Golden Dome&quot; missile defense system, which Forstchen supports as a necessary strategic defense against EMP threats. He stated, &quot;Golden Dome is designed to hit enemy missiles long before they hit over the United States,&quot; somewhat akin to Israel's Iron Dome system, and is estimated to cost around $25 billion over 10 years. He touched on global issues, including North Korea's current restraint, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and Iran's nuclear ambitions. Forstchen also expressed excitement about the upcoming film adaptation of his book &quot;One Second After,&quot; which will be shot in Bulgaria.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and near-death experiencer \u003ca href=\"https://www.pegfields.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peg Fields\u003c/a> shared her profound experiences with out-of-body phenomena, energy healing, and spirit contact, tracing these abilities back to her childhood. Her journey into massage therapy emerged as a healing vocation, where she instinctively helped clients by connecting with their energy. &quot;I just feel like my heart and my being reaches out to the other person,&quot; she explained. Fields emphasized the importance of addressing not just physical ailments but also the energetic and spiritual aspects of healing.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One poignant story involved a client haunted by a spirit named Harold for three years, leading to what Fields described as a &quot;deletion&quot; or &quot;transformation&quot; that ultimately freed the woman from her distress. She also detailed an encounter with a skeptical man at her book signing, who ended up deeply moved when she connected him with a deceased relative. She recalled, &quot;I said, 'Did she have a head injury?' He nodded yes, and Fields saw a vision of the girl being propelled out of a car in a fatal accident when she was a teenager. &quot;She's asking where her blanket is,&quot; she told him, and he broke down crying. The man revealed that his mother had made the girl a pink blanket that was kept safe in the attic all these years.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Her interactions with spirits haven't been without challenges. Fields described a harrowing experience with a stuck soul, a kind of &quot;drunk spirit&quot; that attached itself to her during a visit to Sedona, where she stumbled through the woods, yelling &quot;Get off!&quot; She emphasized the importance of understanding that not all spirits have our best interests at heart, noting, &quot;There are parasitic entities that can attach to a person.&quot; During the last hour, she offered guidance for listeners, including medical readings.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mikebara.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mike Bara\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Second-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765317583/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">One Second After\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Final-Day-Novel-John-Matherson/dp/0765376733/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Final Day: A Novel\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/48-Hours-William-R-Forstchen/dp/0765397919/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">48 Hours\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Shadow-Corner-Short-Supernatural-Stories/dp/B0CVGFRB6M/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>The Shadow In The Corner: 5 Short True Supernatural Stories That Heal … The Heart and Soul\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.sg/Ring-Within-True-Supernatural-Stories/dp/B0D66K4G5G/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Ring Within the Ring\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM74C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM74C"},{"artist":"Dionne Warwick","title":"Anyone Who Had A Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002C7HRC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002C7HRC8"},{"artist":"Rolling Stones","title":"Undercover Of The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001EEAD62/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001EEAD62"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Daughter","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004SV1RM2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004SV1RM2"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Pocketful Of Miracles","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWM6UH6"},{"artist":"Smashing Pumpkins","title":"Tonight, Tonight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00AOMN1EG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00AOMN1EG"},{"artist":"Mr. Mister","title":"Broken Wings","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004LGKM48/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004LGKM48"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCZ0G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCZ0G"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"More","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0048ZDIHK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0048ZDIHK"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"Death Or Glory","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EQRK7KQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EQRK7KQ"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday On My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0F25CG51F/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0F25CG51F"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"The Police","title":"Wrapped Around Your Finger","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000WTSVH8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000WTSVH8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e006225cc137bf244201983","%2F685dd1297093e77038d6e396"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/natural disasters","keywords/ghosts","keywords/spirits","keywords/energy healing","keywords/EMPs","keywords/Golden Dome"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c70271a18155dc96214c","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c71171a18155dc96214d","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c72171a18155dc96214e","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c73071a18155dc96214f","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Universal Mind series.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

nationally syndicated program, \u003cem>Coast to Coast AM\u003c/em>, says if he weren&rsquo;t a  national radio talk show host he&rsquo;d be in politics. Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

the first half, author and military historian \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/forstchen-william-r-38799/\" target=\"_blank\">William R. Forstchen\u003c/a> discussed the potential threats posed by electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks and solar flares, the possibility of America building a protective &quot;Golden Dome,&quot; and the current geopolitical landscape. Known for his novel &quot;One Second After,&quot; he provided a stark overview of EMPs-- an electromagnetic pulse weapon (such as a small atomic bomb) that can disrupt or damage electronic equipment. &quot;The worst case attack would be three such weapons over Eastern, Central, and Western United States, 200 miles above the earth,&quot; he detailed. &quot;When the weapon blows, it sets up an electrostatic discharge, and a gamma ray discharged from the explosion...literally, one second after this, the country goes dark.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Forstchen also described solar flares, or coronal mass ejections (CMEs), as a constant threat, stating, &quot;Once in a while, a CME will cut loose and come straight at us.&quot; He referenced the Carrington Event of 1859, which caused significant damage to telegraph systems, warning that a similar event today could be disastrous given our reliance on technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation shifted to defense strategies, particularly President Trump's proposal for a &quot;Golden Dome&quot; missile defense system, which Forstchen supports as a necessary strategic defense against EMP threats. He stated, &quot;Golden Dome is designed to hit enemy missiles long before they hit over the United States,&quot; somewhat akin to Israel's Iron Dome system, and is estimated to cost around $25 billion over 10 years. He touched on global issues, including North Korea's current restraint, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and Iran's nuclear ambitions. Forstchen also expressed excitement about the upcoming film adaptation of his book &quot;One Second After,&quot; which will be shot in Bulgaria.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, author and near-death experiencer \u003ca href=\"https://www.pegfields.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peg Fields\u003c/a> shared her profound experiences with out-of-body phenomena, energy healing, and spirit contact, tracing these abilities back to her childhood. Her journey into massage therapy emerged as a healing vocation, where she instinctively helped clients by connecting with their energy. &quot;I just feel like my heart and my being reaches out to the other person,&quot; she explained. Fields emphasized the importance of addressing not just physical ailments but also the energetic and spiritual aspects of healing.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>One poignant story involved a client haunted by a spirit named Harold for three years, leading to what Fields described as a &quot;deletion&quot; or &quot;transformation&quot; that ultimately freed the woman from her distress. She also detailed an encounter with a skeptical man at her book signing, who ended up deeply moved when she connected him with a deceased relative. She recalled, &quot;I said, 'Did she have a head injury?' He nodded yes, and Fields saw a vision of the girl being propelled out of a car in a fatal accident when she was a teenager. &quot;She's asking where her blanket is,&quot; she told him, and he broke down crying. The man revealed that his mother had made the girl a pink blanket that was kept safe in the attic all these years.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Her interactions with spirits haven't been without challenges. Fields described a harrowing experience with a stuck soul, a kind of &quot;drunk spirit&quot; that attached itself to her during a visit to Sedona, where she stumbled through the woods, yelling &quot;Get off!&quot; She emphasized the importance of understanding that not all spirits have our best interests at heart, noting, &quot;There are parasitic entities that can attach to a person.&quot; During the last hour, she offered guidance for listeners, including medical readings.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.vortex.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Lauren Weinstein\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mikebara.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mike Bara\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Second-After-William-Forstchen/dp/0765317583/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">One Second After\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Final-Day-Novel-John-Matherson/dp/0765376733/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Final Day: A Novel\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/48-Hours-William-R-Forstchen/dp/0765397919/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">48 Hours\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Shadow-Corner-Short-Supernatural-Stories/dp/B0CVGFRB6M/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>The Shadow In The Corner: 5 Short True Supernatural Stories That Heal … The Heart and Soul\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.sg/Ring-Within-True-Supernatural-Stories/dp/B0D66K4G5G/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Ring Within the Ring\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Bur Said","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM74C/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM74C"},{"artist":"Dionne Warwick","title":"Anyone Who Had A Heart","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002C7HRC8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002C7HRC8"},{"artist":"Rolling Stones","title":"Undercover Of The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001EEAD62/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001EEAD62"},{"artist":"Pearl Jam","title":"Daughter","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004SV1RM2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004SV1RM2"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Tupac Amaru","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007JOM7YC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007JOM7YC"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Pocketful Of Miracles","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HWM6UH6"},{"artist":"Smashing Pumpkins","title":"Tonight, Tonight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00AOMN1EG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00AOMN1EG"},{"artist":"Mr. Mister","title":"Broken Wings","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B004LGKM48/ctoc/?trackAsin=B004LGKM48"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Return To Innocence","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDCZ0G/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDCZ0G"},{"artist":"Perry Como","title":"More","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0048ZDIHK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0048ZDIHK"},{"artist":"The Clash","title":"Death Or Glory","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00EQRK7KQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00EQRK7KQ"},{"artist":"The Easybeats","title":"Friday On My Mind","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0F25CG51F/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0F25CG51F"},{"artist":"Enigma","title":"Sadeness","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TDB110/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TDB110"},{"artist":"The Police","title":"Wrapped Around Your Finger","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000WTSVH8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000WTSVH8"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e006225cc137bf244201983","%2F685dd1297093e77038d6e396"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/natural disasters","keywords/ghosts","keywords/spirits","keywords/energy healing","keywords/EMPs","keywords/Golden Dome"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c70271a18155dc96214c","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c71171a18155dc96214d","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c72171a18155dc96214e","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6863c73071a18155dc96214f","show":"coast","title":"Mon, Jun 30 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Universal Mind series.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit.

He also warned of potential conflicts involving China over Taiwan, stating that the &quot;Chinese plan on moving forward... invading Taiwan somewhere between October 2026 and October 2027.&quot; Advancements in AI will significantly influence future conflicts, he continued, stating &quot;AI will upgrade itself... creating new languages, new algorithms we can't even predict.&quot; He envisions a future where artificial general intelligence (AGI) will evolve into artificial superintelligence (ASI) by 2032, fundamentally altering governance, society, and humans' relationship to work.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>On the economic front, Stickevers drew parallels between current trends and historical crises, such as 1929 and 2008, attributing systemic inflation to massive government debt and monetary debasement. He believes Bitcoin will emerge as a strategic reserve currency, replacing traditional fiat systems. With Bitcoin, &quot;you don't need banks,&quot; he posited, and further that the US government would purchase 1 million Bitcoins over five years as a reserve, and the value of one Bitcoin would rise to $1 million by July of 2029.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, former neuroscience researcher \u003ca href=\"https://www.davidjaybrown.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Jay Brown\u003c/a> and visionary artist and writer \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamseedVR\" target=\"_blank\">Sara Phinn Huntley\u003c/a> talked about the strange beings that appear to people during psychedelic experiences, particularly with DMT (\u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/illustrations-dmt-entities/\" target=\"_blank\">view related illustrations\u003c/a>). Brown explained that DMT (dimethyltryptamine) is an enigmatic psychedelic compound that is also a naturally occurring substance found in many plants and animals. Both guests shared their personal experiences with DMT, which revealed a striking consistency in the reported encounters with otherworldly entities. Huntley recounted her second trip, describing a &quot;sentient being&quot; with a huge fractal surface that was roiling with tessellations and different colors, conveying &quot;a history of the cosmos.&quot; Brown's first experience in 1983 involved a terrifying encounter with a giant praying mantis, which seemed to be conducting a series of tests on him that bore some similarity to alien abduction reports.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Both felt the entities they encountered during their trips were &quot;realer than real,&quot; leading them to ponder the existence of an independent reality associated with these experiences. In creating the illustrations for their book, Huntley noted that she employed AI to visualize these entities, aiming to create &quot;portraits of people's collective consciousness&quot; and foster a shared exploration of the psychedelic experience. Some individuals report encounters with deceased loved ones or ancestors on DMT, or while taking the plant medicine ayahuasca (which contains DMT).\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The conversation delved into the varying types of DMT entities, which can range from benevolent or healing guides to trickster figures. Brown cautioned that DMT experiences are often overwhelming and should be approached with care. He also reported on \u003ca href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/169525/psychonauts-training-psychedelics-dmt-extended-state\" target=\"_blank\">extended-state DMT research\u003c/a> where subjects at Imperial College in London and elsewhere, have the drug administered as an infusion to maintain the &quot;hyperspace&quot; state over longer periods (when smoked it only lasts for 10 minutes), and are sometimes &quot;sent out&quot; in teams to see if they have a shared experience.\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Field-Guide-Entities-Interdimensional/dp/1644119196/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Illustrated Field Guide to DMT Entities\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Psychedelics-Coming-Singularity-Conversations-Sheldrake/dp/1644117983/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Psychedelics and the Coming Singularity\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Frontiers-Psychedelic-Consciousness-Conversations-Stanislav/dp/1620553929/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Frontiers of Psychedelic Consciousness\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFC"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"Starman","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VWYJHCZ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Stealers Wheel","title":"Star","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073N76CB9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073N76CB9"},{"artist":"Donovan","title":"Cosmic Wheels","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0949LQCDQ/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Guess Who","title":"Star Baby","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00137KMAW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00137KMAW"},{"artist":"Creedence Clearwater Revival","title":"Sailor's Lament","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073QYZH2Q/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073QYZH2Q"},{"artist":"Grateful Dead","title":"Cosmic Charlie","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00IBD3BIG/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00IBD3BIG"},{"artist":"Van Morrison","title":"Moondance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07VMPCDS2/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Beatles","title":"Tomorrow Never Knows","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07FSQB6DL/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07FSQB6DL"},{"artist":"Quicksilver Messenger Service","title":"Who Do You Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000V2BCM2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000V2BCM2"},{"artist":"Rolling Stones","title":"She's A Rainbow","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00D2VYXX4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00D2VYXX4"},{"artist":"The Doors","title":"When The Music's Over","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0018AKH0E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0018AKH0E"},{"artist":"Ten Years After","title":"I'd Love To Change The World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0B3SDC785/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0B3SDC785"},{"artist":"Three Dog Night","title":"Mama Told Me Not To Come","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000VZXER0/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000VZXER0"},{"artist":"Kim Carnes","title":"Crazy In The Night","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000TE568I/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000TE568I"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e0061c1cc137bf24420197b","%2F5e01a657cc137bf2442027b4","%2F685de5e07093e77038d6e3a5"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5dfa8b6be99a880e568ef39a"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Richard Syrett"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/astrology","keywords/DMT","keywords/psychedelics"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/686273b89799fad09eaf62df","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 29 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/686273cc9799fad09eaf62e0","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 29 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/686273da9799fad09eaf62e1","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 29 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/686273e99799fad09eaf62e2","show":"coast","title":"Sun, Jun 29 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Space exploration concept.

Mindell noted that the obesity rate in the US and worldwide is growing dramatically. He remarked, &quot;75% of adults are overweight and 40% of them are obese,&quot; predicting that by 2035, half the global population will be in one of these groups due to unhealthy eating habits. He criticized the prevalence of sugar and its many disguises in food products, stating, &quot;There are 32 ways that you can [label] sugar in the United States and get away with it.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Despite these harrowing statistics, Dr. Mindell acknowledged a shift in public perception over the decade. &quot;Health stores were kind of hippy dippy places,&quot; he commented. &quot;Now, they're all over the place... so we've come a long way from then, and we've got a long way to go.&quot; Mindell then introduced a new oral spray for weight management called THIN, which he claimed suppresses appetite effectively. He said the oral spray could help users lose about 10% of body weight in the first month without significant side effects.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He also encouraged listeners to monitor their water intake, suggesting a simple rule of thumb: &quot;Take your weight divided by two—that's how many ounces you need per day.&quot; According to Dr. Mindell, hydration could assist in reducing unnecessary snacking, and his health advice also included consuming higher levels of Vitamin D3 and magnesium. &quot;If we could get everybody in the country who's an adult to take about 5,000 IUs of Vitamin D3, I think we could close half the hospitals because we won't need them,&quot; he asserted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-----------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the second half, \u003ca href=\"http://roswell-investigator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Don Schmitt\u003c/a>, the lead investigator for the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, shared his insights regarding the infamous Roswell incident of 1947. Schmitt's journey into ufology began with his mentorship under Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was the scientific consultant for the Air Force's Project Blue Book. Schmitt recalled, &quot;[Hynek] would say, 'never lose that little boy wonderment... [or] let your imagination get the better of you.'&quot; This ethos guided Schmitt as he explored the mysteries surrounding the Roswell incident.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Schmitt initially approached the investigation with skepticism, expecting to prove the government's narrative. After years of research, however, he admitted, &quot;I was 100% wrong. I was wrong about Roswell.&quot; He noted the government's inconsistent explanations surrounding the incident, recalling that they &quot;have presented four official explanations regarding just this one event.&quot; Schmitt shared his experiences interviewing witnesses, who, regardless of their backgrounds-- from military personnel to local civilians-- provided strikingly similar accounts of the alleged wreckage. Their descriptions consistently shared uncanny traits that remain unexplained by current technology.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Additionally, Schmitt discussed the physical evidence uncovered during archaeological digs at the crash site, including pieces of metal with unusual properties. &quot;There is not a registered compound in the world that combines aluminum and molybdenum... it shouldn't be there,&quot; he stated. When asked about the potential motivations behind government secrecy, he reflected that &quot;there were other forces... pulling the strings.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Dr-Earl-Mindells-Vitamin-Bible/dp/1538737264/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Earl Mindell's Vitamin Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Earl-Mindells-Herb-Bible/dp/1982197196/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Earl Mindell's Herb Bible\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Witness-Roswell-Thomas-J-Carey/dp/1427098956/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Witness To Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Real-Area-51-Patterson/dp/1601632363/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">UFO Secrets Inside Wright-Patterson\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Children-Roswell-Seven-Decade-Intimidation-Cover-Ups/dp/1632650193/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Children of Roswell\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Chase","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B001NSZLFW/ctoc/?trackAsin=B001NSZLFW"},{"artist":"Willie Nelson","title":"On The Road Again","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136PN3E/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136PN3E"},{"artist":"David Bowie","title":"The Man Who Sold the World","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B015D2KEMI/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"The Wallflowers","title":"One Headlight","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W0112Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W0112Y"},{"artist":"Soundgarden","title":"Burden In My Hand","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W01YWQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W01YWQ"},{"artist":"Electric Light Orchestra","title":"Telephone Line","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136RNQO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136RNQO"},{"artist":"Jerry Reed","title":"Talk About the Good Times","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B01DHO29TK/ctoc/?trackAsin=B01DHO29TK"},{"artist":"Chuck Berry","title":"You Never Can Tell","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B07PH5R1CV/ctoc/?trackAsin=B07PH5R1CV"},{"artist":"Iggy Pop","title":"The Passenger","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B071ZHVSXJ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B071ZHVSXJ"},{"artist":"Nine Inch Nails","title":"Head Like A Hole","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0180NO4JQ/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0180NO4JQ"},{"artist":"Warren Zevon","title":"Werewolves of London","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00122ML0W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00122ML0W"},{"artist":"Bob Dylan","title":"Duquesne Whistle","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0094U0SFE/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0094U0SFE"},{"artist":"Alice In Chains","title":"I Stay Away","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00MHR0VIA/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00MHR0VIA"},{"artist":"The Crystal Method","title":"Busy Child","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B000W27B1W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B000W27B1W"},{"artist":"Johnny Cash","title":"Folsom Prison Blues","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136Q036/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136Q036"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B007GMYJI4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B007GMYJI4"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e0067bacc137bf2442019e4","%2F5e000ac0537fd678a3ece715"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F6826ed959549d8cf707b59c6"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"Ryan Wrecker"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/semaglutide","keywords/weight loss","keywords/ufology"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/686111f1550f32c441c84dd8","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 28 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/68611284550f32c441c84dd9","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 28 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/6861168e550f32c441c84dda","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 28 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/686116c9550f32c441c84ddb","show":"coast","title":"Sat, Jun 28 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"Astronaut walking towards UFO.","id":"%2F685ddccc4e4b9a5b207d6809","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/685ddccc4e4b9a5b207d6809","source_credit":"gremlin / E+ / Getty Images","title":"Astronaut walking towards UFO","url":"asset://assets.getty/685ddccc4e4b9a5b207d6809","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1751119200000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2025-06-28-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://drearlmindell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Earl Mindell\u003c/a> spoke about an oral spray for weight loss called THIN, and pressing health issues related to the American diet.

Grace is known for her long career as an &quot;energy surgeon&quot; and has worked with millions worldwide on their emotional and spiritual wellbeing. She described her approach as deeply interconnected with the Native American concept of the medicine wheel. Grace's version of this wheel represents the sacred trinity of the inner female, inner male, and inner child, which she emphasized are present within everyone. &quot;If we would take the time to communicate with those aspects of ourselves, we could solve a lot of problems,&quot; she remarked.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She highlighted that many interpersonal conflicts often stem from disharmony between these inner aspects. &quot;The female side gathers the information, while the male side takes it out,&quot; Grace explained. She also introduced the concept of alien influence in the spiritual realm, claiming an increase in alien encounters and attachments during her sessions. &quot;I cannot tell you how much alien influence is coming through right now,&quot; she stated. Grace sees these entities as parasitic, attaching to those with lower vibrations resulting from harmful lifestyle choices or emotional turmoil.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>She spoke candidly about her ability to clear such attachments from her clients' energy fields, sharing that some clients have come from powerful positions. &quot;I've cleared aliens out of people in the White House,&quot; she claimed. Despite the challenges posed by these influences, Grace expressed unwavering optimism for the future of humanity, emphasizing the power of compassion and unity. &quot;I believe in the heart, the human heart,&quot; she noted, underscoring the need to come together to elevate the collective vibration. &quot;If we would just stop and wait a minute, we all have the same things that we want,&quot; she insisted.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>--------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The second half featured Open Lines, where listeners call in to discuss topics of interest.

Mike from Coldfoot, Alaska shared a fascinating anecdote about a family friend spotting a Sasquatch in North Dakota.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>John from Michigan recounted a personal encounter with a craft displaying flames and unusual flight patterns. Gary from Providence, Rhode Island spoke about a spiritual awakening tied to biblical prophecies, saying his idea of the future involves a new Big Bang. Ruth from Maryland shared a local legend about a witch from 1698 who faced persecution and a curse, linking supernatural events to her tale. Jeffrey from Salt Lake City recounted his experience witnessing a mysterious light blue object crash in Idaho in 2003.

Reflecting on Serling's profound impact on television, he noted, &quot;Twilight Zone is more famous than ever... they're still proving a point and telling a story.&quot; Serling, who passed away at just age 50, was unaware of the enduring popularity his work would achieve, Zicree remarked.

The Twilight Zone was on for five seasons and was mainly a half-hour show, but in its fourth season, it expanded to an hour for 18 episodes.

Reflecting on his early influences, Zicree recounted a poignant moment when he met Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura in the original &quot;Star Trek,&quot; and 50 years later made an appearance in &quot;Space Command.&quot;\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, C2C's investigative reporter \u003ca href=\"https://cherylljones.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Cheryll Jones\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003cu>,\u003c/u> shared her interview with \u003ca href=\"https://pattinegri.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Patti Negri\u003c/a>, psychic medium and &quot;Good Witch of Hollywood.&quot; Negri discussed her lifelong connection to the spirit world and how she utilizes her gifts to assist people in navigating everyday challenges.

She provided practical advice for personal space cleansing, encouraging listeners to &quot;sweep out the negativity,&quot; such as with a kitchen broom, and fill their homes with positive intentions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Negri told Cheryll about her &quot;30-second elemental balancing exercises&quot; to reconnect with the four elements-- water, earth, fire, and air, which can affect one's emotions, creativity, and clarity. &quot;Go run your hands underwater for 30 seconds. Water is like an aspirin for a headache,&quot; she explained, urging listeners to engage with the elements to recalibrate their energy. She also discussed protective magic, advocating for the use of symbols like the Norse &quot;\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm_of_Awe\" target=\"_blank\">Helm of Awe\u003c/a>&quot; (which appears like an 8-sided cross) to break up negative energies. &quot;You can protect yourself with a mirrored bubble,&quot; she suggested, explaining how it reflects negativity while allowing positivity to enter.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Kitchen magic was another fascinating topic; she described her kitchen as a &quot;magic lab&quot; where the ingredients carry their own energies. &quot;Basil is really good to calm things. Apples are really good for love,&quot; she said. Furthermore, stirring dishes clockwise while cooking, or with a cup of tea, can help you realize your intentions, she advised.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>During the last half-hour, George featured an excerpt from his \u003ca href=\"https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2018-02-12-show/\" target=\"_blank\">2/12/18 interview\u003c/a> with witchcraft author Fiona Horne.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://natureoflongevity.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Douglas Mulhall\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://kevinrandle.blogspot.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Kevin Randle\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Zone-Companion-Scott-Zicree/dp/1935247174/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Twilight Zone Companion\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0061059579/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Time\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Love-Gloria-Memoir-My-Mother/dp/B0CVQKX2SP/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Love, Gloria: A Memoir of My Mother\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Old-World-Magick-Modern-Techniques/dp/1733545506/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Old World Magick for the Modern World\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://amazon.com/Dollcraft-Witchs-Poppet-Magick-Haunted/dp/073877748X/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Dollcraft: A Witch's Guide to Poppet Magick &amp;

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

There is a disconnect between urban dwellers and the agricultural community, he said, noting that &quot;only 2% of us now live and work on farms,&quot; which diminishes the farmers' influence in political discourse. Highlighting the potential of small-scale farming in urban settings, he argued that efficiency and creativity can lead to significant profits, challenging the notion that only large farms can succeed. He advocated for a &quot;warrior&quot; mindset in farming, encouraging producers to confidently dictate prices rather than accept whatever is offered.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Olson introduced three essential laws regarding food and agriculture. The first is that &quot;agriculture is the foundation upon which we build our sand castles,&quot; and modern civilization often overlooks the importance of farming. &quot;Without a surplus of food, we will all have to spend our time turning over logs, looking for things to eat,&quot; he stated. The second law asserts that &quot;the farther we go from the source of our food, the less control we have over what's in our food.&quot; He encouraged listeners to connect with local farmers and farmer's markets.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His third law critiques the notion of cheap food, explaining that while &quot;we have cheap food thanks to our industrial agriculture,&quot; it comes at a cost, including hidden expenses associated with food production, and health care issues stemming from poor nutrition. Olson also raised concerns about food security, referencing incidents involving bioterrorism threats to the food supply.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>----------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, documentary filmmaker and supernaturalist \u003ca href=\"https://lamarzulli.net/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>L. A.

Marzulli emphasized the shroud's uniqueness, stating, &quot;It's not a painting... it's forensic evidence of the greatest event in all history, the resurrection.&quot; He described the shroud as &quot;God's calling card&quot; and noted that no one has successfully replicated the image on it, despite a million-dollar challenge for anyone who can.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Marzulli elaborated on the shroud's historical journey, mentioning its presence in Jerusalem and subsequent travels through Turkey, France, and finally Italy. He argued that the carbon dating, which suggested the shroud was a medieval fake, was flawed due to a potential reweaving in the 15th century. He also reported on the shroud's scientific intrigue, citing its three-dimensional properties and the distinct frontal and dorsal images of a crucified man.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>His film aims to connect the shroud with the miraculous phenomenon of the Holy Fire, which has been reported at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem for centuries. Marzulli described it as &quot;mystical&quot; and &quot;supernatural,&quot; recounting how the fire spontaneously ignites lamps without any apparent source. The Sudarium of Oviedo, housed in Spain, is a bloodstained linen fabric, believed by some to be the cloth that covered Jesus' face after his death. &quot;When you take the sudarium and overlay it over the face on the shroud, &quot;there's 120 points of congruency between the two artifacts,&quot; he marveled.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://howardbloom.net\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Howard Bloom\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem>, \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://mishtalk.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>Mish Shedlock\u003c/em>\u003c/a>\u003cem> \u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\n"}]},"books":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://metrofarm.com/product/metrofarm-the-guide-for-growing-for-profit-in-or-near-the-city/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>MetroFarm\u003c/u>\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rungs-Disclosure-Following-Trail-Extraterrestrials/dp/1636414486/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">Rungs of Disclosure\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alien-Interviews-Conversations-experienced-Contacts-ebook/dp/B08JKBDNF4/ctoc\" target=\"_blank\">The Alien Interviews\u003c/a>\u003c/li>\u003c/ul>\n\n"},"bumper_music":{"type":"bumpermusic","value":[{"artist":"Giorgio Moroder","title":"Midnight Express (The Chase)","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B09S2274RD/ctoc/?trackAsin=B09S2274RD"},{"artist":"Led Zeppelin","title":"All My Love","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0011Z95N6/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0011Z95N6"},{"artist":"Blood Sweat & Tears","title":"Spinning Wheel","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B073M8GBF9/ctoc/?trackAsin=B073M8GBF9"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"We Didn’t Start The Fire","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136JD9Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136JD9Y"},{"artist":"The Shirelles","title":"Will You Love Me Tomorrow","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0086K07FO/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0086K07FO"},{"artist":"Gary Wright","title":"Love Is Alive","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002FTD4YI/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002FTD4YI"},{"artist":"Frank Sinatra","title":"Summer Winds","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00TU1BU0Y/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00TU1BU0Y"},{"artist":"Motley Crue","title":"Same Ol’ Situation","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0DZVNV6L4/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0DZVNV6L4"},{"artist":"Dionne Warwick","title":"Walk On By","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B002C79B9U/ctoc/?trackAsin=B002C79B9U"},{"artist":"Nickelback","title":"Rockstar","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0011Z0YR2/ctoc/?trackAsin=B0011Z0YR2"},{"artist":"Gene Wilder","title":"Pure Imagination","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B003NJN77S/ctoc/?trackAsin=B003NJN77S"},{"artist":"AC/DC","title":"Who Made Who","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00O6YVI5W/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00O6YVI5W"},{"artist":"Crosby Stills & Nash","title":"Southern Cross","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00123HXG8/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00123HXG8"},{"artist":"Bob Seger","title":"Night Moves","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B0721LDJSV/ctoc/?1"},{"artist":"Billy Joel","title":"The Longest Time","url":"https://amazon.com/dp/B00136RTMC/ctoc/?trackAsin=B00136RTMC"},{"artist":"Cusco","title":"Inca Dance","url":"https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B007GMZFOQ"}]},"display_highlights":{"type":"checkbox","value":false},"episodes":{"type":"plain","value":""},"guest":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5e0226e5537fd678a3ecfbb5","%2F5e002510cc137bf24420174e"]},"highlights":{"type":"plain","value":""},"host":{"type":"link","value":["%2F5df90403fc5c6051ef1778c3"]},"host_name":{"type":"plain","value":"George Noory"},"include_recommendations":{"type":"checkbox","value":true},"keywords":{"type":"tag","value":["keywords/food chain","keywords/Shroud of Turin","keywords/agriculture"]},"pn_podcast":{"type":"pnpodcast","value":[{"episodeId":"/episodes/685d2143fae6f6b603f41e86","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jun 25 2025 - Hour 1"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/685d215ffae6f6b603f41e87","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jun 25 2025 - Hour 2"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/685d217bfae6f6b603f41e88","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jun 25 2025 - Hour 3"},{"episodeId":"/episodes/685d2195fae6f6b603f41e89","show":"coast","title":"Wed, Jun 25 2025 - Hour 4"}]},"primary_image":{"type":"asset","value":{"alt_text":"","attributes":{"mimetype":"image/jpeg","type":"image"},"bucket":"assets.getty","caption":"","id":"%2F66c7de34fbc2b1be3080413a","link":"","new_tab":false,"public_uri":"https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.getty/66c7de34fbc2b1be3080413a","source_credit":"Philippe Lissac / The Image Bank Unreleased / Getty Images","title":"Shroud of Turin","url":"asset://assets.getty/66c7de34fbc2b1be3080413a","use_caption":false}},"show_audio":{"type":"link","value":[]},"show_date":{"type":"date","value":1750860000000},"slug":{"type":"slug","value":"2025-06-25-show"},"summary":{"type":"html","value":"\u003cp>Author \u003ca href=\"https://metrofarm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Michael Olson\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed the advantages of living closer to the source of our food.

Heard by millions of  listeners\u003cem>, Coast To Coast AM\u003c/em> airs on nearly 620 stations in the U.S., Canada, Mexico  and Guam.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While hosting \u003cem>The Nighthawk\u003c/em>, a wildly successful,  late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, Noory was recruited by Premiere Radio  Networks to guest host on \u003cem>Coast to Coast  AM \u003c/em>with Art Bell.&nbsp; He became the  permanent host of the phenomenally successful over-night program on January 1, 2003,  following Bell&rsquo;s retirement. &nbsp;Since then, Noory&rsquo;s audience has continued to  grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory captivates  program listeners with his discussions of paranormal phenomena, time travel,  alien abductions, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

He emphasized the importance of understanding economic cycles, stating, &quot;Recessions are the most important thing for long-term productivity. They clean out all the excesses.&quot; He argued that the Federal Reserve's approach to managing the economy through stimulus and deficit spending is detrimental, suggesting that &quot;we're throwing away free market capitalism&quot; by relying on government intervention. He believes that the ongoing economic bubble, fueled by excessive stimulus, is unsustainable and predicts a necessary downturn.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>While recessions may seem unpleasant, they serve a critical purpose in maintaining economic health, he said. He argued that the massive stimulus measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic have created an unsustainable financial bubble. Dent predicts that a crash will occur between late 2025 and 2028, and warns that it could be &quot;worse&quot; than previous downturns, with real estate values potentially dropping by 60% to 80% in some cases. He advised potential investors to wait for the market to stabilize before considering real estate purchases, with the best opportunities emerging around 2027-2030.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Addressing the rise of artificial intelligence, he acknowledged it will likely automate many professional jobs but that this shift should encourage people to explore entrepreneurship. Everybody's going to have to figure out what they do best and turn it into a business, he commented. Dent remains optimistic about the future, asserting that the emerging world will continue to grow, particularly in regions like India.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Author and podcaster \u003ca href=\"https://jimharold.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Jim Harold's\u003c/u>\u003c/a> show &quot;The Paranormal Podcast&quot; is one of the longest-running podcasts in its genre. In the latter half, he shared spooky stories and reflected on his two-decade journey in the realm of the supernatural and podcasting. &quot;I believe... the nature of our reality is so much stranger and deeper than we understand,&quot; he said, highlighting the vastness of paranormal experiences that often go unnoticed. Harold explained how he collects stories from listeners, stating, &quot;We just put the call out... and we say, hey, if you've got a true paranormal story, could be ghosts, could be UFOs, could be crypto-creatures.&quot; This unscripted approach has led to thousands of personal accounts, showcasing a broad spectrum of paranormal phenomena, including tales of Shadow People, and the sinister 'Black-Eyed Children.'\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Harold recounted a humorous and thought-provoking tale from a listener named Mary, whose toddler unexpectedly chimed in during a discussion about Reptilians, saying, &quot;People not ready yet,&quot; leaving his parents stunned. He also discussed a chilling experience involving a Ouija board, where a group of teenage girls inadvertently summoned a devil's face in a lava lamp, prompting them to abandon the board immediately.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He recalled a recent eerie encounter from a listener named Lane, who worked at a hotel where a guest had been murdered. Lane reported strange occurrences, including a voice on his radio that sounded like the deceased uttering 'I'm still alive,' and an elevator that behaved erratically. &quot;I think he forged that connection with that ghost,&quot; Harold opined. Reflecting on the evolution of storytelling in his 20 years of podcasting, he noted that people are increasingly willing to share their paranormal experiences, particularly spiritual and ghostly ones, while still feeling some apprehension about discussing UFO sightings and especially alien abductions.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>\u003cem>News segment guests: \u003c/em>\u003ca href=\"https://www.onlinecolumnist.com\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cem>John M.

He is  driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time.  From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to cover  stories that the mainstream media never touch&mdash;the unusual, the paranormal and  things like that. I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13.

Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.

Many early AI systems, previously known as knowledge-based systems, ultimately failed, he asserted, and &quot;very little of what they're calling AI today is really AI;&quot; it's actually relational databases at work. McCanney emphasized that while AI may perform adequately in controlled environments, it struggles to adapt to the unpredictable nature of human behavior, especially with autonomous vehicles.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>He expressed alarm over the integration of AI into critical societal functions, the replacement of humans in these services, and the lack of foresight in maintaining or fixing its systems. When fully integrated into crucial systems like government and healthcare, AI's failures could have drastic consequences, he lamented.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>Regarding pole shifts, he distinguished between magnetic and physical ones. While magnetic shifts occur frequently, he said, &quot;The physical pole shift is very rare... it requires a large body passing by Earth,&quot; perhaps as big as the planet Venus. McCanney noted that physical pole shifts could have catastrophic effects, causing earthquakes of a magnitude unheard of today. Such a phenomenon &quot;is the only thing that explains mountain building...literally a land tsunami from a large passing object,&quot; he added. He suggested that ancient populations may have survived such events. \u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>-------------\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>In the latter half, researcher, writer, and activist \u003ca href=\"https://peterakirby.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\u003cu>Peter A. Kirby\u003c/u>\u003c/a> discussed his research on chemtrails and geoengineering, and the alarming agenda he believes is in play. According to Kirby, chemtrail spraying contains toxic substances, such as coal fly ash, that are harmful to humans and ecosystems. He likened the situation to a &quot;nascent version of Skynet&quot; from \u003cem>The Terminator\u003c/em> movies, indicating that a powerful, autonomous system is behind the scenes, possibly related to the MITRE Corporation and DARPA.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp>The spraying, he continued, is part of a broader agenda for control, and a future where the establishment could dictate environmental conditions, manipulating everything from weather to food production. There are intricate connections between the global narcotics trade and covert operations involving geoengineering, Kirby asserted.

I learned that broadcast was the best business for exploring  these issues, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it for 33 years.&rdquo;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>He dates his  interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, \u003cem>We Are Not Alone,\u003c/em> that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was  hooked.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Prior to his late-night show on KTRS,  Noory had an extensive broadcast career.&nbsp;  He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit where his first-ever interview was with  nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman.&nbsp; From 1974-1978, he served as news producer  and executive news producer at WJBK-TV.&nbsp;  At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the  country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis.\u003cstrong>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Noory was also  the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards  while a news executive.\u003c/p>\n\n\u003cp> Noory released his first book in 2006.  \"Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential,\" co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory’s revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness.  Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow up in 2009 entitled \u003ci>Journey to the Light\u003c/i>, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth.  In October 2011, Noory released his third book, \u003ci>Talking To The Dead\u003c/i>.  Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology.  Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released \"Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\" in February 2015.  Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there’s still no sign of it whatsoever, it’s time to think outside the box. \u003cp>\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched \"Beyond Belief with George Noory,\" a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe.  The one-hour, weekly series features Noory’s informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program.  Taped at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively at \u003ca href = \"http://www.beyondbelief.com/\" target = \"_Blank\"> beyondbelief.com\u003c/a>.  Noory has also appeared on the History Channel's \u003ci>Ancient Aliens\u003c/i>, SYFY, The Larry King Show and numerous others. \n\n\u003cp>He was born,  raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren.

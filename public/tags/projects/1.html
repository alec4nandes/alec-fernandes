measure of determination, either that or downright stubbornness. After Reddit scoffed at <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my first attempt</a> to combine tarot cards and artificial intelligence, I adapted my idea into a new app called <a href="https://inspotarot.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InspoTarot</a>. </p> <p> As I mentioned in <a href="/blog/delfai-oracle.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my last post</a>, I had a disastrous experience trying to market artificial intelligence to Reddit’s tarot community. The feedback was nearly unanimous: AI has no place in the realm of tarot readings. They told me this new technology was either too much of a threat to living, breathing professionals or else too cold, impersonal and fundamentally incapable of doing a good job. </p> <p> I admit this might be true for those tarot readings that seek deep spiritual insight into the nature of one’s problems or something as intangible as a person’s future, but fortune telling with the cards has never really been my thing. I am a pretty pragmatic and secular card reader who sees the deck as more an avenue for psychoanalysis than for winning the lottery. So in a last-ditch effort to imbue the deck with the power of AI, I created another web app more focused on science than on clairvoyance. </p> <p> One of the books I read last year was a collection of essays on the shadow self, a concept popularized by the psychologist Carl Jung. This is the side of our mind that is unconsciously repressed. Another source even told me Jung expressed curiosity in the potential of tarot to tap into the archetypes of the unconscious psyche. Inspired by this idea, my new app asks a user to pick five cards where each has at least one word relating to the person’s current condition. After the selection, the app analyzes the spread's chosen words while also pointing out the unchosen words for each card. </p> <p> These “shadow” words, I thought, could give insight into a person’s shadow self. The idea here is that each card is a semantic unit in itself, so if at least one associated word has conscious relevance, maybe the words not picked have unconscious meanings as well. </p> <p> Sadly, this new format wasn’t popular either. Adding shadow work into the mix didn’t change people’s view that artificial intelligence is too impersonal for any kind of card reading, even one based in the science of psychology. I now admit defeat and won’t be pushing tarot-meets-AI anymore, but I’m glad I tried. </p> <p> Pursuing one’s passions is always rewarding, even if it results in failure. In creating <a href="https://inspotarot.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InspoTarot</a> I learned more about psychology and the delightfully complex process of streaming API responses from OpenAI. And just like with <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delfai Oracle</a>, I’m proud of what I created and am happy to post it <a href="https://inspotarot.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here in my portfolio</a>. </p> </div> <div class="tags"> tags: <ul class="commas"> <li> <a href="/tags/projects/1.html">projects</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/ai/1.html">AI</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/api/1.html">API</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/openai/1.html">OpenAI</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/tarot/1.html">tarot</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/shadow-work/1.html">shadow work</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/carl-jung/1.html">Carl Jung</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/reddit/1.html">Reddit</a> </li> </ul> </div> <button class="share-button" data-id="inspotarot" onclick="copyLink(event)"> share <img src="/assets/icons8-share-24.png" alt="" /> </button> </article> <article> <h2 class="title"> <a href="/blog/delfai-oracle.html">Where artificial intelligence doesn’t belong</a> </h2> <h3 class="subtitle">AI, in some situations, can go both too far and not far enough.</h3> <p class="date-posted">2024-02-09T11:15-08:00</p> <figure> <img src="/assets/feature-images/priestess-of-delphi_john-collier_1891-min.jpg" /> <figcaption>Priestess of Delphi by John Collier (1891)</figcaption> </figure> <div><p> <em> <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">View this project.</a> </em> </p> <p> Artificial intelligence is fast becoming an ubiquitous part of the modern world, but attitudes towards this new technology remain divisive. I encountered this while promoting my new web app, <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delfai Oracle</a>. </p> <p> <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">This app</a> I created allows users to enter custom spreads or pick a number of random cards. It then reads these cards with the power of AI, composing a summary about the essence of the reading. When I promoted the beta version to different communities on Reddit, the response I received was vitriolic. No one saw the time-saving value of of my creation, either as a supplemental tool for professionals or as an instructional one for those curious about what light the cards could shed on their lives. Virtually every tarot fan saw my creation as either an existential threat to the human element of their passion or else something innately incapable of ever reading the cards. To this latter group, <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delfai Oracle</a> completely lacked the human empathy that so many clients seek, and that so many professionals wish to give. </p> <p> Perhaps it was my fault for thinking that something as personally intimate as a tarot card reading could translate to the world of artificial intelligence. To my credit, however, I saw the possibility of summarizing the myriad meanings of the deck in a matter of seconds as a blessing, not a curse, to the tarot community. It's often difficult (at least for me) to find common ground among contradicting cards in a spread. One reads success, another failure. Love and heartbreak, health and sickness – sometimes the overall message is so up, down, and all around that it's impossible to find a common theme. </p> <p> AI's appeal lies in its ability to quickly find connections. Entire novels can be read and summarized in a matter of minutes, pointing out subtle nuances that may be lost on a pair of human eyes. I thought both tarot readers and clients would praise someone who brought this power to their field, but I was severely mistaken. </p> <p> Despite the blowback, I don’t regret building <a href="https://delfai.web.app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this project</a>. It stands here as yet another portfolio piece that demonstrates how I can implement an artificial intelligence API into a website, streaming each response word by word from OpenAI’s server. I even decided to make another iteration with my next web app, <a href="/blog/inspotarot.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InspoTarot</a>, using similar techniques. </p></div> <div class="tags"> tags: <ul class="commas"> <li> <a href="/tags/projects/1.html">projects</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/ai/1.html">AI</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/api/1.html">API</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/openai/1.html">OpenAI</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/tarot/1.html">tarot</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/reddit/1.html">Reddit</a> </li> </ul> </div> <button class="share-button" data-id="delfai-oracle" onclick="copyLink(event)"> share <img src="/assets/icons8-share-24.png" alt="" /> </button> </article> <article> <h2 class="title"> <a href="/blog/prova-lab.html">Prova Lab Social Innovation</a> </h2> <h3 class="subtitle">Innovative companies deserve innovative websites.</h3> <p class="date-posted">2023-06-16T13:51-07:00</p> <figure> <img src="/assets/feature-images/prova-lab.jpg" /> <figcaption>The landing page I designed for <a href="https://provalabsocialinnovation.web.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prova Lab</a>.</figcaption> </figure> <div><p><a href="https://provalabsocialinnovation.web.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Visit Prova Lab Social Innovation.</em></a></p> <p> Prova Lab Social Innovation is on a mission to make sure today's ideas don't become tomorrow's problems. What better way to break this toxic cycle than by networking with bright minds over drinks? </p> <p> On a summer evening in San Francisco I attended <a href="https://provalabsocialinnovation.web.app/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 'SIP' event</a> hosted by Prova Lab. The lighthearted bar setting balanced serious discussion topics, subjects such as threats to the environment and cognitive bias when it comes to measuring success in innovation. Here was a diverse group talking about how to fix a planet just getting back on its feet after 2.5 years of Covid, and it inspired me. That night I saw a light shine out of the pandemic darkness not far behind us. </p> <p> Prova Lab's directors hired me to give them an online presence as bright as their ideas, so I designed and built <a href="https://provalabsocialinnovation.web.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this landing page</a> with a dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">parallax scrolling</a> effect. I wanted something innovative and modern, yet implementing this scroll behavior proved to be as challenging as it was visually rewarding. </p> <p> At first I had difficulty maintaining a clean, consistent perspective for each background image in the separate home sections. There could be no spaces or overlaps between backgrounds as they moved at a synchronized speed slower than the foreground text's movement. </p> <p> What looked good on one screen size would sometimes be majorly askew on other devices. It was a heavily involved process of selecting images with the right size, proportion and message, but the hard work paid off. <a href="https://provalabsocialinnovation.web.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The site now shines brightly</a> on the web as a beacon for innovators all over the world. </p> <p> If you're looking to improve your web presence, I can help.

Show me some JSON and I'll start piecing together all the ways I can parse and display it for any user. It's because I have the mind of a web developer, and I've accepted that. We're an odd, creative, stubborn bunch with a hint of a god complex. Our digital creations are our babies and we don't want anyone playing with them in ways we don't expect. That's why developers need to play nice in the sandbox – they need to respect each other's rules. </p> <p> Last year I discovered <a href="https://github.com/MushroomObserver/mushroom-observer/blob/master/README_API.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mushroom Observer's API</a> and fell in love. This data endpoint contains photos, dates and coordinates of different fungi found around the world. It's a valuable tool for amateur mycologists like me who want to get an idea of the mushrooms growing in their area, but this tool was from a third party and had rules I didn't fully understand. </p> <p> I set up <a href="https://mapsplatform.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Map's API</a> and started writing a function that took coordinates from the embedded map along with a radius in miles and then fetched data using Mushroom Observer's endpoint. The function returned data about a random mushroom within the user's specified boundaries. </p> <p> Soon I was testing coordinates all over the globe, amazed to see beautiful high-resolution images of local species anywhere I clicked on the map. The excitement of browsing these world-wide woods gave me an idea to pull as many images of the randomly selected mushrooms as possible, even from different Mushroom Observer posts. I pushed each image gallery to be bigger and bigger, but I also pushed my luck. </p> <p> My greed for more images led me to make too many API calls within too short a timeframe. Instead of picture links and fungi data, the API now returned a message warning me that I was abusing the service. A brief panic arose. Here I was deep into testing my new site, and the souce of all my data locked me out. </p> <p> Up until that point I wasn't a fan of hiding my IP address. I never had anything to hide online, and I was usually too busy on international trips to stream my American TV shows using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VPN</a>. Now I actually needed one. Thankfully I found free VPN apps for mobile and desktop that allowed me to hide my blacklisted IP address on both devices. I could keep testing the website I had already invested so much time into, but it wasn't the most honest solution. As <a href="/moon-sun-tides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fellow API developer</a> I can feel Mushroom Observer's frustration at me dodging their blacklist, yet I also think that a permanent ban is a major deterrent for curious developers who innovate with this amazing service. </p> <p> At the end of the day it's the endpoint developers' right to protect their data and servers from abusive and repetitive calls. Mushroom Observer's warning message even directed me to contact their team and explain the purpose of my app. Only then will my home IP be removed from their blacklist. This is more than fair, and I plan to contact them ASAP to streamline development of <a href="/mushrooms/find.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this feature</a> on my <a href="/mushrooms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mushrooms website</a>. </p> <p> To effectively use existing tools to build any project, it's necessary to understand the limitations of those tools. There are plenty of things they can do, plenty of things they can't, and things they can do but simply shouldn't. Building on the web is no different. Be sure to research <strong>all</strong> related technologies before you dive into your next project so that you fully understand how far you can push it. </p></div> <div class="tags"> tags: <ul class="commas"> <li> <a href="/tags/projects/1.html">projects</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/mushrooms/1.html">mushrooms</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/geolocation/1.html">geolocation</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/google-maps/1.html">Google Maps</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/mushroom-observer/1.html">Mushroom Observer</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/api/1.html">API</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/vpn/1.html">VPN</a> </li> </ul> </div> <button class="share-button" data-id="mushrooms" onclick="copyLink(event)"> share <img src="/assets/icons8-share-24.png" alt="" /> </button> </article> <article> <h2 class="title"> <a href="/blog/moon-sun-tides-api.html">Moon-Sun-Tides API</a> </h2> <h3 class="subtitle">Read the code documentation before you copy and paste.</h3> <p class="date-posted">2023-06-02T13:52-07:00</p> <figure> <img src="/assets/feature-images/moon-sun-tides-api.jpg" /> <figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tegethoff?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Tegethoff</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/NbgQfUvKFE0?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption> </figure> <div><p><a href="/moon-sun-tides" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>View this project.</em></a></p> <p> Creating <a href="/moon-sun-tides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my own API</a> proved that rarely anything in programming is accomplished alone – instead it's built on the backs of the many engineers that came before. Another lesson it taught me: don't just copy code from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a>. This online forum is only a starting point, and programmers should <strong>always</strong> read a solution's original documentation to really understand what they're working with. </p> <p> The API that I built combined, in my opinion, the most requested time data for natural phenomena: sunsets, sunrises, full and new moons, and tides both high and low. I was surprised a single simple endpoint for all this data didn't already exist. Maybe I didn't dig deep enough, or maybe I didn't want to. What I wanted instead was to create my own. </p> <p> The online forums helped me find three separate sources for this project: </p> <ul> <li><a href="https://sunrise-sunset.org/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunrise-Sunset</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lune" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lune (npm)</a></li> <li><a href="https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOAA Tides and Currents</a></li> </ul> <p> These endpoints had already done the hard work of observing the natural world. Now all I needed to do was make one simple API from these three more complicated ones. </p> <p> Stack Overflow had great examples of each one, and all the data seemed correct and uniform with one exception: <a href="https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOAA's Tides API</a>. The example I found returned dates and times in the coordinates' local timezone (without telling the timezone), but I needed them to be in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTC</a> timezone of the sun and moon times. </p> <p> <em> Side note: If users want to convert UTC timestamps to ones in their local timezones, they can simply create new JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Date objects</a> from the timestamps: </em> </p> <pre><code><xmp>new Date("2023-01-10 13:00 +0");
// prints "Tue Jan 10 2023 05:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)"
// since I'm in California.
</xmp></code></pre> <h3>Solving the problem</h3> <p> This situation got me thinking about how to convert a local time to a UTC timestamp when I knew the coordinates but not the timezone. I came up with the following approach in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pseudocode</a>: </p> <ul> <li>Calculate the timezone offset from UTC (for example, Pacific Standard Time = -8).</li> <li>Create <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a template literal</a> with the local date, time and timezone offset: <pre><code><xmp>`${date} ${time} ${offset}`</xmp></code></pre></li> <li>Pass the resulting string into <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Date object</a>.</li> <li>Get the UTC timestamp from this Date object with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toUTCString" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.toUTCString()</a> method.</li> </ul> <p> There is a nifty node package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/geo-tz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geo-tz</a> that takes coordinates and returns their timezone offset, which let me successfully implement the pseudocode above. Hooray, the function worked! But did I really need to do all those extra steps? </p> <h3>An easier solution</h3> Even though the approach above works, it's redundant for the tides API. I don't need to convert any timezones because NOAA's API can do it for me with its <a href="https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/#timezone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time_zone</a> parameter. The example endpoint I found on the forums set this value as <em>lst</em> for <em>Local Standard Time</em>, but the original documentation listed another option: <em>gmt</em> for <em>Greenwich Mean Time</em>, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UTC</a>. <p> I wouldn't have known this was possible if I hadn't studied the code docs. <strong>Always</strong> review the original documentation for any language, class or API that you use. Stack Overflow is a great tool for pointing programmers in the right direction, but it's up to them to go further. They need to know <strong>both</strong> that a solution works <strong>and how</strong> it can work better for their specific project. </p></div> <div class="tags"> tags: <ul class="commas"> <li> <a href="/tags/projects/1.html">projects</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/api/1.html">API</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/javascript/1.html">JavaScript</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/dates/1.html">dates</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/documentation/1.html">documentation</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/pseudocode/1.html">pseudocode</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/template-literals/1.html">template literals</a> </li> <li> <a href="/tags/nature/1.html">nature</a> </li> </ul> </div> <button class="share-button" data-id="moon-sun-tides-api" onclick="copyLink(event)"> share <img src="/assets/icons8-share-24.png" alt="" /> </button> </article> </main> <div class="pagination"> <p>page 1 of 3</p> <a href="./2.html">older >></a> </div> <a href="/contact" class="sticky-contact"> <img src="/assets/mail-icon.png" alt="" /> </a> <footer> <div id="footer-container"> <a href="/">home</a> <a href="/blog">blog</a> <a href="/contact">contact</a> </div> </footer> <script src="/src/scripts.js"></script> </body> </html>
